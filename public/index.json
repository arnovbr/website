I remember the first time I had to calculate drug costs. Back then, working with Microsoft Excel for a real project was excitingly new for me. However, I got quickly frustrated with this seemingly simple task. The price for a ‘simple’ dose of let’s say 125mg per patient can be calculated in different ways. Especially, when I had chose a combination from a plethora of smaller doses. It may happen that you may have to combine smaller doses of 2.5mg, 5mg, 15mg, 50mg or 100mg to derive the needed 125mg. Maybe you would chose for 100mg + 50mg and discard or reuse the rest. Or you go for 100mg + 15mg + 5mg + 5mg. Many more options are possible and your decision wouldn’t really matter if the price of larger mg’s would be a multiple of the smaller doses. But this is not always the case.
