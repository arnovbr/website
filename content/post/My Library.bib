  abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the incidence and predictive factors for development of transformed lymphoma in a population-based series of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Lymphoid Cancer Database was used to identify patients with FL diagnosed and treated in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Transformed lymphoma was defined as the development of aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) in patients with FL. Factors present at the time of initial diagnosis of indolent NHL and at transformation were analyzed for their impact on risk of transformation and subsequent outcome. RESULTS: Between 1986 and 2001, 600 patients with newly diagnosed FL met the inclusion criteria. With a median follow-up of 109 months (range, 10 to 244), 170 (28\%) developed transformation, 107 (63\%) based on biopsy confirmation. The annual risk of transformation was 3\% continuously through 15 years. A multivariate analysis of clinical factors at diagnosis identified advanced stage as the only predictor of future transformation. The median post-transformation survival was 1.7 years. The 5-year survival was superior for patients with limited extent transformation compared with those with advanced cases (66\% v 19\%, P {$<$} .0001). Patients with transformation based on clinical versus histological criteria had an identical median survival of 1.8 years (P = .2). CONCLUSION: The annual risk of transformation of FL is 3\% continuing without plateau beyond 15 years. Advanced stage at diagnosis is predictive of future transformation. Clinically diagnosed transformation has an equal impact on outcome as biopsy proven transformation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is the standard treatment for patients with relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or transformed indolent lymphoma (TIL). The treatment is mainly considered for younger patients still available for the work market. In this study, social outcomes after ASCT in terms of return to work (RTW) are described. PATIENTS AND METHODS Information from national administrative registers was combined with clinical information on patients, who received ASCT for relapse of DLBCL or TIL between 2000 and 2012. A total of 164 patients were followed until RTW, disability or old-age pension, death, or December 31, 2015, whichever came first. A total of 205 patients were followed with disability pension as the event of interest. Cox models were used to determine cause-specific hazards. RESULTS During follow-up, 82 (50\%) patients returned to work. The rate of returning to work in the first year following ASCT was decreased for patients being on sick leave at the time of relapse (hazard ratio [HR] 0.3 [0.2;0.5]) and increased for patients aged {$\geq$}55 years (HR 1.9 [1.1;3.3]). In all, 56 (27\%) patients were granted disability pension. Being on sick leave at the time of relapse was positively associated with receiving a disability pension in the first 2 years after ASCT (HR 3.7 [1.8;7.7]). CONCLUSION Patients on sick leave at the time of relapse have a poorer prognosis regarding RTW and have a higher rate of disability pension. Furthermore, patients {$>$}55 are more likely to RTW compared to younger patients. These results indicate an unmet need for focused social rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract In a study comparing the effects of two treatments, the propensity score is the probability of assignment to one treatment conditional on a subject's measured baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is increasingly being used to estimate the effects of exposures using observational data. In the most common implementation of propensity-score matching, pairs of treated and untreated subjects are formed whose propensity scores differ by at most a pre-specified amount (the caliper width). There has been a little research into the optimal caliper width. We conducted an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to determine the optimal caliper width for estimating differences in means (for continuous outcomes) and risk differences (for binary outcomes). When estimating differences in means or risk differences, we recommend that researchers match on the logit of the propensity score using calipers of width equal to 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit of the propensity score. When at least some of the covariates were continuous, then either this value, or one close to it, minimized the mean square error of the resultant estimated treatment effect. It also eliminated at least 98\% of the bias in the crude estimator, and it resulted in confidence intervals with approximately the correct coverage rates. Furthermore, the empirical type I error rate was approximately correct. When all of the covariates were binary, then the choice of caliper width had a much smaller impact on the performance of estimation of risk differences and differences in means.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Follicular lymphomas (FLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphomas. No standard of care exists, and the management of these patients is highly individualized.
METHODS: After reviewing the scientific literature pertaining to the prognosis and management of FLs, we describe recent developments in treatment and discuss future trends in the care of patients with this disease.
RESULTS: With the exception of a subset of patients with limited-stage FL treated with radiation therapy, no curative treatment exists for the majority of patients with FL. The decision on when to start treatment is based on the presence of symptoms, bulky disease, or abnormalities in hematologic parameters that can be attributed to FL. Prognostic scoring systems such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index help in assessing prognosis but do not contribute to the decision on when to start treatment. There are numerous effective chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of advanced-stage FL, but none show a definitive improvement in overall survival. Maintenance and consolidation regimens have also been shown to be effective treatments of FL, with significant improvements in progression-free survival and possibly overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Newer prognostic tests are in development that may help to guide the decision on which patients may benefit from early treatment. In addition, newer targeted agents that may improve on existing outcomes with less toxicity are currently being evaluated.},

  abstract = {Purpose. The association between prescription burden and medication adherence in patients initiating antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was studied. Methods. Patients enrolled in managed care organizations who initiated anti-hypertensive therapy coincident with lipid-lowering therapy (no more than 90 days apart) between January 1, 1997, and April 30, 2000, were eligible for inclusion. Analysis was limited to new users of anti-hypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. The proportion of days covered (PDC) by antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was calculated for the first year after therapy initiation; patients with a PDC of {$\geq$}80\% for both drug classes were considered adherent. Prescription burden Suite 303, Falls Church, VA 22046 (rchapman@us.imshealth.com). was defined as the number of prescription medications taken in the year prior to starting antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Demographic, clinical, and health-service-use variables associated with both prescription burden and medication adherence were measured using medical and pharmacy claims data from the year before initiation of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Results. Among 5759 patients, the mean {$\pm$} S.D. prescription burden was 3.6 {$\pm$} 3.7 (median, 3) medications, and the mean {$\pm$} S.D. PDC with antihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy was 53.9\% {$\pm$} 31.9\% (me-dian, 58.5\%). Among patients with 0, 1, and 2 prior medications, 41\%, 35\%, and 30\% of patients were adherent , respectively, to an-tihypertensive and lipid-lowering therapy. Among patients with 10 or more prior medications, 20\% were adherent. Conclusion. Among patients in a managed care database taking antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications, adherence to those regimens became less likely as the number of prescription medications increased. The reduction in adherence with additional prescription medications was greatest in patients with the fewest preex-isting prescriptions.},

  abstract = {Background We report on the treatment of children and adolescents with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first relapse. The protocol focused on: (1) Intensive chemotherapy preceding allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in early bone marrow relapse; (2) Rotational chemotherapy in late relapse, without donor; (3) Postponement of cerebro-spinal irradiation in late isolated CNS relapse; and (4) Treatment in very late bone marrow relapse with chemotherapy only. Methods From January 1999 until July 2006 all 158 Dutch pediatric patients with ALL in first relapse were recorded. Ninety-nine patients were eligible; 54 patients with early and 45 with late relapse. Eighteen patients had an isolated extra-medullary relapse; 69 patients had bone marrow involvement only. Results Five-years EFS rates for early and late relapses were 12\% and 35\%, respectively. For early relapses 5 years EFSs were 25\% for patients transplanted; 0\% for non-transplanted patients. For late relapses 5 years EFS was 64\% for patients treated with chemotherapy only, and 16\% for transplanted patients. For very late relapses EFS was 58\%. Conclusions Our data suggest the superiority of SCT for early relapse patients. For late relapses a better outcome is achieved with chemotherapy only using the rotational chemotherapy scheme. The most important factor for survival was interval between first CR and occurrence of the first relapse. Pediatr Blood Cancer 2011; 57: 210\textendash{}216. \textcopyright{} 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Median age at HCT was 36.5 years, and median length of follow-up was 7.6 years. Overall survival was 68.8\% +/- 1.8\% at 10 years, and the cohort was at a 13-fold increased risk for late death (standardized mortality ratio [SMR] = 13.0) when compared with the general population. Mortality rates approached those of the general population after 10 years among patients at standard risk for relapse at HCT (SMR = 1.1) and in patients undergoing transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia (AML; SMR = 0.9). Relapse of primary disease (56\%) and subsequent malignancies (25\%) were leading causes of late death. Relapse-related mortality was increased among patients with Hodgkin disease (HD; relative risk [RR] = 3.6), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; RR = 2.1), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; RR = 6.5). Total body irradiation (RR = 0.6) provided a protective effect. Nonrelapse-related mortality was increased after carmustine (RR = 2.3) and with use of peripheral blood stem cells (RR = 2.4). Survivors were more likely to report difficulty in holding jobs (RR = 9.4) and in obtaining health (RR = 7.7) or life insurance (RR = 8.4) when compared with siblings. Although mortality rates approach that of the general population after 10 years in certain subgroups, long-term survivors of autologous HCT continue to face challenges affecting their health and well-being.},

Developments in the protocol for SCT have resulted in cost estimates that require updating. We aimed to calculate actual costs for SCT and to identify major cost drivers by means of a daily practice cost study. We randomly selected 191 patients, treated at three university hospitals, who underwent an autologous (auto) SCT or allogeneic (allo) SCT in 2007, 2008 or 2009. Allo-SCT included sibling donors, matched unrelated donors (MUD) and umbilical cord blood (UCB). Resource use was collected from the hospital registration systems and medical files. The total costs included selection and harvesting of stem cells, transplantation and 1-year follow-up. The average costs per patient were 45,670 \texteuro{} for auto-SCT and 101,919 \texteuro{} for sibling allo-SCT. The costs of transplantations from unrelated donors were much higher: 171,478 \texteuro{} for allo-SCT-MUD and 254,689 \texteuro{} for allo-SCT-UCB. Hospital inpatient days together with laboratory and other activities were the main cost drivers across all types of SCT. Besides, donor search costs were a large cost component in allo-SCT-sib (18 \%) and allo-SCT-MUD (12 \%). Real-world costs were above routine reimbursement and appropriate financing is necessary to guarantee the continuation of SCT. The costs calculated in this study provide reliable up-to-date input for cost-effectiveness studies and budget revision.},

  abstract = {Objectives On the basis of two population-based registries, our study aims to calculate the real-world cost-effectiveness of rituximab maintenance compared with observation in relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma patients who responded to second-line chemotherapy. Methods Data were obtained from the EORTC20981 trial, the Netherlands Cancer Registry and two population-based registries. A Markov model was developed to calculate cost per life year gained (LYG) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for three scenarios. Results Our real-world patients were (62 years) 6 to 7 years older and had higher complete response rates to second-line chemotherapy than the trial population. Differences between the real-world rituximab and observation group were observed for second-line chemotherapy and disease progression. Groups were more balanced after using propensity matching. Relying entirely on updated trial results (scenario1) in combination with local cost data resulted in ratios of \texteuro{}11 259 per LYG and \texteuro{}12 655 per QALY. For scenario2, consisting of trial efficacy and matched real-world costs, ratios of \texteuro{}21 202 per LYG and \texteuro{}23 821 per QALY were calculated. Using real-world matched evidence (scenario3) for both effectiveness and costs showed ratios of \texteuro{}10 591 per LYG and \texteuro{}11 245 per QALY. Conclusion Although differences in real-world and trial population were found, using real-world data as well as results from long-term trial follow-up showed favourable ICERs for rituximab maintenance. Nevertheless, results showed that caution is required with data synthesis, interpretation and generalisability of results. As different scenarios provide answers to different questions, we recommend healthcare decision-makers to recognise the importance of calculating several cost-effectiveness scenarios.},

  abstract = {Decision makers increasingly request evidence on the real-world cost effectiveness of a new treatment. There is, however, a lack of practical guidance on how to conduct an economic evaluation based on registry data and how this evidence can be used in actual decision making. This paper explains the required steps on how to perform a sound economic evaluation using examples from an economic evaluation conducted with real-world data from the Dutch Population based HAematological Registry for Observational Studies. There are three main issues related to using registry data: confounding by indication, missing data, and insufficient numbers of (comparable) patients. If encountered, it is crucial to accurately deal with these issues to maximize the internal validity and generalizability of the outcomes and their value to decision makers. Multivariate regression modeling, propensity score matching, and data synthesis are well-established methods to deal with confounding. Multiple imputation methods should be used in cases where data are missing at random. Furthermore, it is important to base the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a new treatment compared with its alternative on comparable groups of (matched) patients, even if matching results in a small analytical population. Unmatched real-world data provide insights into the costs and effects of a treatment in a real-world setting. Decision makers should realize that real-world evidence provides extremely valuable and relevant policy information, but needs to be assessed differently compared with evidence derived from a randomized clinical trial.},

Occurrence of grade III/IV haematological AEs, defined according to CTC-NCI guidelines criteria, was derived from the laboratory registration. Mean age at time of diagnosis was 48 years; 56\% male. A healthcare perspective was adopted.

The mean cost of febrile neutropenia amounted to 2,462 euro.\textbackslash{}n\textbackslash{}nCONCLUSIONS: Treatment costs of AEs varied considerably. However, apart from the cost of anaemia, the results presented seem to be in line with information from the international literature. The key limitations of the study concern the relatively small cohort of patients at a single centre, the retrospective design and the various treatment regimens of CML during the follow-up.},

Adherence to antihypertensive (AH) and lipid-lowering (LL) therapy is therefore particularly important in older patients with concomitant hypertension and dyslipidaemia. Objective: To determine patterns and predictors of adherence to concomitant AH and LL therapy among an older Medicare-eligible population. Methods: Enrolees (n = 4052) aged {$\geq$}65 years who initiated treatment with both AH and LL therapy within a 90-day period were studied in this retrospective cohort study conducted in a US managed care organization. Adherence to AH and LL medications was measured as the proportion of days covered by any AH and/ or LL medication in each 3-month interval, from the start of concomitant therapy for up to 36 months (mean follow-up 19.5 months). In each interval, patients were considered 'adherent' to AH and LL therapy if they had filled prescriptions sufficient to cover {$\geq$}80\% of days with both medication classes. A multivariable regression model evaluated potential predictors of adherence to concomitant therapy, including patient demographics, clinical characteristics and health services use patterns at baseline. Results: The percentage of patients adherent to both AH and LL therapy declined rapidly, before stabilizing, with 40.5\%, 32.7\% and 32.9\% adherent at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. At each timepoint, an additional 27.8-35.0\% of patients were adherent to either AH or LL therapy, but not both. Adherence was on average greater to AH than LL therapy. After adjusting for age, sex and other potential predictors, patients were more likely to be adherent if AH/LL therapies were initiated closer together in time (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.13 for 0-30 days vs 61-90 days, p = 0.0563), had a history of cardiovascular disease (AOR 1.27, p = 0.0004), took fewer additional medications (AOR 0.43 for six or more medications vs zero or one medication, p {$<$} 0.0001) or had more outpatient 886 Chapman et al. physician visits in the prior year (AOR 1.26 for four to six visits vs zero to one visit, p {$<$} 0.0027).

  abstract = {Background
Phase 3 randomized trials have shown that maintenance rituximab (MR) therapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT) consolidation following frontline therapy can improve progression-free survival for patients with follicular lymphoma (FL), but the cost-effectiveness of these approaches with respect to observation has not been examined using a common modeling framework.
Objectives
To evaluate and compare the economic impact of MR and RIT consolidation versus observation, respectively, following the first-line induction therapy for patients with advanced-stage FL.
Methods
We developed Markov models to estimate patients' lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and life-years (LYs) after MR, RIT, and observation following frontline FL treatment from the US payer's perspective. Progression risks, adverse event probabilities, costs, and utilities were estimated from clinical data of Primary RItuximab and MAintenance (PRIMA) trial, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) trial (for MR), and First-line Indolent Trial (for RIT) and the published literature. We evaluated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for direct comparisons between MR/RIT and observation. Model robustness was addressed by one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
Results
Compared with observation, MR provided an additional 1.089 QALYs (1.099 LYs) and 1.399 QALYs (1.391 LYs) on the basis of the PRIMA trial and the ECOG trial, respectively, and RIT provided an additional 1.026 QALYs (1.034 LYs). The incremental cost per QALY gained was \$40,335 (PRIMA) or \$37,412 (ECOG) for MR and \$40,851 for RIT. MR and RIT had comparable incremental QALYs before first progression, whereas RIT had higher incremental costs of adverse events due to higher incidences of cytopenias.
Conclusions
MR and RIT following frontline FL therapy demonstrated favorable and similar cost-effectiveness profiles. The model results should be interpreted within the specific clinical settings of each trial. Selection of MR, RIT, or observation should be based on patient characteristics and expected trade-offs for these alternatives.},

METHODS The International Working Group response criteria (Cheson et al, J Clin Oncol 17:1244, 1999) were widely adopted, but required reassessment because of identified limitations and the increased use of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and flow cytometry. The International Harmonization Project was convened to provide updated recommendations. RESULTS New guidelines are presented incorporating PET, IHC, and flow cytometry for definitions of response in non-Hodgkin's and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Standardized definitions of end points are provided. CONCLUSION We hope that these guidelines will be adopted widely by study groups, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and regulatory agencies to facilitate the development of new and more effective therapies to improve the outcome of patients with lymphoma.},

  abstract = {The main rationale for using biosimilar drugs is for cost saving. The market development for biosimilar drugs will therefore depend on the degree to which cost saving measures are required by nations, medical insurers and individuals and the absolute savings that could be gained by switching from original drugs. This paper is designed to discover the degree to which financial constraints will drive future health spending and to discover if legal or safety issues could impact on any trend. A structured literature search was performed for papers and documents to 27 August 2011. Where multiple sources of data were available on a topic, data from papers and reports by multinational or national bodies were used in preference to data from regions or individual hospitals. Almost all health systems face current significant cost pressures. The twin driver of increasing cancer prevalence as populations age and cancer medicine costs rising faster than inflation places oncology as the most significant single cost problem. For some countries, this is predicted to make medicine unaffordable within a decade. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a cost-control measure. Biosimilar introduction into the EU has already forced prices down, both the price of biosimilar drugs and competitive price reductions in originator drugs. Compound annual growth rates of use have been predicted at 65.8\% per year. Most developed countries have planned to embrace biosimilar use as a major cost-control measure. Only legal blocks and safety concerns are likely to act against this trend. For centralised healthcare systems, and those with a strong tradition of generic medicine use, biosimilar use will clearly rise with predictions of more than 80\% of prescriptions of some biologic drugs within 1~year of market entry in the USA. Delaying the implementation of such programmes however risks a real crisis in healthcare delivery for many countries and hospitals that few can now afford.},

A working correlation structure for the repeated measures of the outcome variable of a subject needs to be specified by this method. However, statistical criteria for selecting the best correlation structure and the best subset of explanatory variables in GEE are only available recently because the GEE method is developed on the basis of quasi-likelihood theory. Maximum likelihood based model selection methods, such as the widely used Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), are not applicable to GEE directly. Pan (2001) proposed a selection method called QIC which can be used to select the best correlation structure and the best subset of explanatory variables. Based on the QIC method, we developed a computing program to calculate the QIC value for a range of different distributions, link functions and correlation structures. This program was written in Stata software. In this article, we introduce this program and demonstrate how to use it to select the most parsimonious model in GEE analyses of longitudinal data through several representative examples.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rituximab maintenance therapy was shown to significantly extend overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma (FL) in the pivotal EORTC 20981 trial.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term costs and cost effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy after induction therapy versus current standard practice (observation) from the French National Health Service perspective.
METHODS: A lifetime transition model was developed comparing rituximab maintenance with observation. PFS and OS were obtained from the EORTC 20981 trial with a median follow-up of 28 months and extrapolated from 2-year Kaplan-Meier curves using a Weibull distribution. PFS and OS benefits of rituximab were conservatively assumed to last only 5 years. Utility data were obtained from a multicentre observational study using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Direct medical costs were obtained from French official sources. All costs are reported in euro, year 2006 values.
RESULTS: The EORTC 20981 study demonstrated that rituximab maintenance was effective in the management of relapsed/refractory FL. The model results showed that life expectancy and QALYs were increased by 22\% and 28\%, respectively, in patients treated with rituximab. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were euro 7612 per life-year gained and euro 8729 per QALY gained. In a one-way sensitivity analysis, most of the ICERs fell within the range of euro 7000-12,000. The results tend to show that rituximab maintenance therapy may be a cost-effective strategy in the management of relapsed/refractory FL in France, with ICERs below those observed for other therapies in the oncology field. The cost of rituximab was partly offset by the lower cost of relapse due to a longer time in the disease-free health state for patients in the rituximab arm.},

  abstract = {Background: Translating prognostic and diagnostic biomarker candidates into clinical applications takes time, is very costly, and many candidates fail. It is therefore crucial to be able to select those biomarker candidates that have the highest chance of successfully being adopted in the clinic. This requires an early estimate of the potential clinical impact and commercial value. In this paper, we aim to demonstratively evaluate a set of novel biomarkers in terms of clinical impact and commercial value, using occurrence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type-2 diabetes (DM2) patients as a case study.
Methods: We defined a clinical application for the novel biomarkers, and subsequently used data from a large cohort study in The Netherlands in a modeling exercise to assess the potential clinical impact and headroom for the biomarkers.
Results: The most likely application of the biomarkers would be to identify DM2 patients with a low CVD risk and subsequently withhold statin treatment. As a result, one additional CVD event in every 75 patients may be expected. The expected downstream savings resulted in a headroom for a point-of-care device ranging from \texteuro{}119.09 at a willingness to accept of \texteuro{}0 for one additional CVD event, to \texteuro{}0 at a willingness to accept of \texteuro{}15,614 or more.
Conclusion: It is feasible to evaluate novel biomarkers on outcomes directly relevant to technological development and clinical adoption. Importantly, this may be attained at the same point in time and using the same data as used for the evaluation of association with disease and predictive power.},

  abstract = {While outcomes for children with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have improved dramatically, survival rates for patients with relapsed/refractory disease remain dismal. Prior studies indicate that glucocorticoid (GC) resistance is more common than resistance to other chemotherapies at relapse. In addition, failure to clear peripheral blasts during a prednisone prophase correlates with an elevated risk of relapse in newly diagnosed patients. Here we show that intrinsic GC resistance is present at diagnosis in early thymic precursor (ETP) T-ALLs as well as in a subset of non-ETP T-ALLs. GC-resistant non-ETP T-ALLs are characterized by strong induction of JAK/STAT signaling in response to interleukin-7 (IL7) stimulation. Removing IL7 or inhibiting JAK/STAT signaling sensitizes these T-ALLs, and a subset of ETP T-ALLs, to GCs. The combination of the GC dexamethasone and the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib altered the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic factors in samples with IL7-dependent GC resistance, but not in samples with IL7-independent GC resistance. Together, these data suggest that the addition of ruxolitinib or other inhibitors of IL7 receptor/JAK/STAT signaling may enhance the efficacy of GCs in a biologically defined subset of T-ALL.},

In this article, we summarize the theoretical debates and empirical research in this area and highlight the conclusions that can be drawn for current practice. For future related and future unrelated medical costs, the literature suggests that inclusion is required to obtain optimal outcomes from available resources. This conclusion does not depend on the perspective adopted by the decision maker. Future non-medical costs are only relevant when adopting a societal perspective; these should be included if the benefits of non-medical consumption and production are also included in the evaluation. Whether this is the case currently remains unclear, given that benefits are typically quantified in quality-adjusted life-years and only limited research has been performed on the extent to which these (implicitly) capture benefits beyond health. Empirical research has shown that the impact of including future costs can be large, and that estimation of such costs is feasible. In practice, however, future unrelated medical costs and future unrelated non-medical consumption costs are typically excluded from economic evaluations. This is explicitly prescribed in some pharmacoeconomic guidelines. Further research is warranted on the development and improvement of methods for the estimation of future costs. Standardization of methods is needed to enhance the practical applicability of inclusion for the analyst and the comparability of the outcomes of different studies. For future non-medical costs, further research is also needed on the extent to which benefits related to this spending are captured in the measurement and valuation of health benefits, and how to broaden the scope of the evaluation if they are not sufficiently captured.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Treatment with CHOP chemotherapy in elderly patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is less effective and accompanied by more adverse effects than in younger patients. The prophylactic use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) might improve the results, but increases the costs of treatment. We analyzed the costs of therapy and follow-up of patients with NHL treated with CHOP with or without G-CSF prophylaxis. DESIGN AND METHODS Four hundred and eleven patients were randomized for treatment with CHOP or CHOP+G-CSF. A detailed study of treatment costs from randomization until 3 years of follow-up or death was performed in a subset of 100 out of 389 eligible patients. Because costs during follow-up were independent of the use of G-CSF during treatment, costs of follow-up and second-line treatment were calculated irrespective of the treatment arm. RESULTS Total hospital costs for first-line treatment were 12178 [95\% CI 10297 - 14059] for CHOP alone and 18356 [95\% CI 15807 - 20906] for CHOP + G-CSF. Costs during follow-up showed a wide difference (range 74 - 53925) depending on disease status and choice of treatment in the case of relapse or progression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS The clinical study showed no difference between the treatment arms in response, overall survival or event-free survival, while the costs were significantly higher in the G-CSF arm. We conclude that the addition of prophylactic G-CSF to CHOP chemotherapy is not cost-effective in these patients.},

This study focussed on decisions about the initial price and reimbursement status of innovative drugs and discussed the consequences for market access and cost. Four countries were studied: Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. These countries have operated one, or both, of the two policies at certain points in time, sometimes in parallel. Drugs in four groups were considered: cholesterol-lowering agents, insulin analogues, biologic drugs for rheumatoid arthritis and ``atypical'' drugs for schizophrenia. Compared with HTA, reference pricing is a relatively blunt instrument for obtaining value for money from pharmaceuticals. Thus, its role in making reimbursement decisions should be limited to drugs which are therapeutically equivalent. HTA is a superior strategy for obtaining value for money because it addresses not only price but also the appropriate indications for the use of the drug and the relation between additional value and additional costs. However, given the relatively higher costs of conducting HTAs, the most efficient approach might be a combination of both policies.},

The aim of this article was to provide a more detailed analysis of the characteristics of gene therapy and the extent to which these characteristics warrant modifications to the methods suggested in general reference cases for economic evaluation. We argue that a completely new reference case is not required, but propose a tailored checklist that can be used by analysts and decision makers to determine which aspects of economic evaluation should be considered further, given the unique nature of gene therapy.},

We developed a high-throughput sequencing method that universally amplifies antigen-receptor gene segments and identifies all clonal gene rearrangements (ie, leukemia-specific sequences) at diagnosis, allowing monitoring of disease progression and clonal evolution during therapy. In the present study, the assay specifically detected 1 leukemic cell among greater than 1 million leukocytes in spike-in experiments. We compared this method with the gold-standard MRD assays multiparameter flow cytometry and allele-specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction (ASO-PCR) using diagnostic and follow-up samples from 106 patients with ALL. Sequencing detected MRD in all 28 samples shown to be positive by flow cytometry and in 35 of the 36 shown to be positive by ASO-PCR and revealed MRD in 10 and 3 additional samples that were negative by flow cytometry and ASO-PCR, respectively. We conclude that this new method allows monitoring of treatment response in ALL and other lymphoid malignancies with great sensitivity and precision.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of the F2 study was to verify whether a prospective collection of data would enable the development of a more accurate prognostic index for follicular lymphoma (FL) by using parameters which could not be retrospectively studied before, and by choosing progression-free survival (PFS) as principal end point.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2003 and May 2005, 1,093 patients with a newly diagnosed FL were registered and 942 individuals receiving antilymphoma therapy were selected as the study population. The variables we used for score definition were selected by means of bootstrap resampling procedures on 832 patients with complete data. Procedures to select the model that would minimize errors were also performed.
RESULTS: After a median follow-up of 38 months, 261 events for PFS evaluation were recorded. beta2-microglobulin higher than the upper limit of normal, longest diameter of the largest involved node longer than 6 cm, bone marrow involvement, hemoglobin level lower than 12 g/dL, and age older than 60 years were factors independently predictive for PFS. Using these variables, a prognostic model was devised to identify three groups at different levels of risk. The 3-year PFS rate was 91\%, 69\%, and 51\% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (log-rank = 64.6; P {$<$} .00001). The 3-year survival rate was 99\%, 96\%, and 84\% for patients at low, intermediate, and high risk, respectively (P {$<$} .0001).
CONCLUSION: Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index 2 is a simple prognostic index based on easily available clinical data and may represent a promising new tool for the identification of patients with FL at different risk in the era of immunochemotherapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Although rituximab (R) is commonly used for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) requiring treatment, the optimal associated chemotherapy regimen has yet to be clarified.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted an open-label, multicenter, randomized trial among adult patients with previously untreated stages II to IV FL to compare efficacy of eight doses of R associated with eight cycles of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) or six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or six cycles of fludarabine and mitoxantrone (FM). The principal end point of the study was time to treatment failure (TTF).
RESULTS: There were 534 patients enrolled onto the study. Overall response rates were 88\%, 93\%, and 91\% for R-CVP, R-CHOP, and R-FM, respectively (P=.247). After a median follow-up of 34 months, 3-year TTFs were 46\%, 62\%, and 59\% for the respective treatment groups (R-CHOP v R-CVP, P=.003; R-FM v R-CVP, P=.006; R-FM v R-CHOP, P=.763). Three-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 52\%, 68\%, and 63\% (overall P=.011), respectively, and 3-year overall survival was 95\% for the whole series. R-FM resulted in higher rates of grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (64\%) compared with R-CVP (28\%) and R-CHOP (50\%; P{$<$} .001). Overall, 23 second malignancies were registered during follow-up: four in R-CVP, five in R-CHOP, and 14 in R-FM.
CONCLUSION: In this study, R-CHOP and R-FM were superior to R-CVP in terms of 3-year TTF and PFS. In addition, R-CHOP had a better risk-benefit ratio compared with R-FM.},

This publication provides long-term follow-up data. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were monitored for a minimum of 5 years after completion of study treatment for the time-to-event end points of progression-free survival (PFS), event-free survival, duration of response, and overall survival per investigator assessment. Data on the number of patients who received second-line anticancer treatment and the occurrence of other malignancies were also collected. RESULTS The medians were not reached for any of the time-to event end points for either the BR or R-CHOP/R-CVP study treatment groups by study completion. PFS rates at 5 years were 65.5\% in the BR treatment group and 55.8\% in the R-CHOP/R-CVP group. The difference in PFS was considered significant with a hazard ratio of 0.61 (95\% CI, 0.45 to 0.85; P = .0025). The hazard ratio for event-free survival and duration of response ( P = .0020 and .0134, respectively) also favored the BR regimen over R-CHOP/R-CVP. However, no significant difference in overall survival was observed. The overall safety profiles of BR, R-CHOP, and R-CVP were as expected; no new safety data were collected during long-term follow-up. A higher number of secondary malignancies was noted in the BR treatment group. CONCLUSION Overall, BR demonstrated better long-term disease control than R-CHOP/R-CVP and should be considered as a first-line treatment option for patients with indolent and mantle-cell lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Background
Cost-utility analyses for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) require health state utility values (HSUVs) in order to calculate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for each health state.

Aim
This study reviewed AML-related HSUVs that could be used in economic evaluation studies.

Materials and methods
EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from January 2000 to November 2016 for relevant studies that reported quality of life (QoL) and HSUVs in AML. Identified relevant European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 values were mapped to HSUVs. HSUVs for each health state in the AML treatment pathway were then collated.

Results
Ten relevant studies were identified. Six were cost-effectiveness analyses utilizing HSUVs for calculation of QALYs, one was an effectiveness analysis (incremental QALY), and two were QoL studies reporting AML-specific utilities. An additional study reported QoL for patients undergoing stem cell transplantation (SCT). Since no study reported HSUVs for relapse, values from a study of secondary AML patients who failed prior treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome were used. Where multiple HSUVs were available, collected values were given priority over assumed values. AML treatment (induction, consolidation, or SCT) was associated with decreased HSUV, while post-treatment complete remission led to increased HSUV.

Conclusion
There are some methodologically robust HSUVs that can be directly used in economic evaluations for AML. Careful interpretation is advised considering significant differences in methodologies and patient population (inclusion, size). We need to develop HSUVs with larger-sized studies, making greater use of condition-specific data.},

  abstract = {Disease overview Follicular lymphoma is generally an indolent B cell lymphoproliferative disorder of transformed follicular center B cells. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is characterized by diffuse lymphadenopathy, bone marrow involvement, splenomegaly and less commonly other extranodal sites of involvement. In general, cytopenias can occur but constitutional symptoms of fever, nightsweats, and weight loss are uncommon. Diagnosis Diagnosis is based on histology of preferably a biopsy of a lymph node. Immunohistochemical staining is positive in virtually all cases for cell surface CD19, CD20, CD10, and monoclonal immunoglobulin, as well as cytoplasmic expression of bcl-2 protein. The overwhelming majority of cases have the characteristic t(14;18) translocation involving the IgH/bcl-2 genes. Risk stratification The Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index prognostic model for FL uses five independent predictors of inferior survival: age {$>$}60 years, hemoglobin {$<$}12 g/dL, serum LDH {$>$} normal, Ann Arbor stage III/IV, number of involved nodal areas {$>$} 4. The presence of 0, 1, 2, and {$\geq$} 3 adverse factors defines low, intermediate, and high-risk disease. With the use of more modern therapies, outcomes have improved. Risk-adapted therapy Observation continues to be adequate for asymptomatic patients with low bulk disease and no cytopenias, with no survival advantage for early treatment with either chemotherapy or rituximab alone. For patients needing therapy, most patients are treated with chemotherapy plus rituximab, which has improved response rates, duration of response and overall survival. Randomized studies have shown additional benefit for maintenance rituximab both following chemotherapy-rituximab and single agent rituximab. Experimental therapies as well as stem cell transplantation (SCT) are considered for recurrent disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The objective was to quantify the health-related quality of life (HRQL) of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and identify specific disabilities for remediation.
PROCEDURE: Two types of subjects were included: ALL patients 5 plus years old in a multi-center clinical trial and general population control groups. Patients were assessed during all four major phases of active treatment and approximately 2 years after treatment. Health status and HRQL were measured using HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX\textregistered{} (HUI\textregistered{}) Mark 2 (HUI2) and Mark 3 (HUI3). HRQL scores were used to calculate quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Excess disability rates identified attributes for remediation.
RESULTS: HUI assessments (n = 749) were collected during the five phases. Mean HRQL increased from induction through the post-treatment phase (P {$<$} 0.001). There were no significant demographic or treatment effects on HRQL, except for type of asparaginase during continuation therapy (P = 0.005 for HUI2 and P = 0.007 for HUI3). Differences in mean HRQL scores between patients and controls were important (P {$<$} 0.001) during the active treatment phases but not during the post-treatment phase. Relative to controls, patients lost approximately 0.2 QALYs during active treatment. Disability was evident in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care and pain, and declined over time.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALL experienced important but declining deficits in HRQL during active treatment phases: Equivalent to losing approximately 2 months of life in perfect health. HRQL within the 2-years post-treatment phase was similar to controls. The policy challenge is to develop new treatment protocols producing fewer disabilities in mobility/ambulation, emotion, self-care, and pain without compromising survival.},

Results from 3 pooled single-arm tisagenlecleucel clinical trials and a provincial pediatric cancer registry were combined to create treatment and control arms, respectively. The population-based control arm consisted of patients meeting clinical trial inclusion and exclusion criteria, starting at second relapse. Multistate and individual-level simulation modeling were combined to predict patient lifetime health trajectories by treatment strategy. Tisagenlecleucel efficacy was modeled across long-term cure rates, from 10\% to 40\%, to account for limited information on its long-term effectiveness. Uncertainty was tested with 1-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis.

T cell co-stimulation by lenalidomide or pomalidomide is cereblon dependent: however, the CRL4(CRBN) substrates responsible for T cell co-stimulation have yet to be identified. Here we demonstrate that interaction of the transcription factors Ikaros (IKZF1, encoded by the IKZF1 gene) and Aiolos (IKZF3, encoded by the IKZF3 gene) with CRL4(CRBN) is induced by lenalidomide or pomalidomide. Each agent promotes Aiolos and Ikaros binding to CRL4(CRBN) with enhanced ubiquitination leading to cereblon-dependent proteosomal degradation in T lymphocytes. We confirm that Aiolos and Ikaros are transcriptional repressors of interleukin-2 expression. The findings link lenalidomide- or pomalidomide-induced degradation of these transcriptional suppressors to well documented T cell activation. Importantly, Aiolos could serve as a proximal pharmacodynamic marker for lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as healthy human subjects administered lenalidomide demonstrated Aiolos degradation in their peripheral T cells. In conclusion, we present a molecular model in which drug binding to cereblon results in the interaction of Ikaros and Aiolos to CRL4(CRBN) , leading to their ubiquitination, subsequent proteasomal degradation and T cell activation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Major guidelines regarding the application of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) have recommended the common and widespread use of the "societal perspective" for purposes of consistency and comparability. The objective of this Task Force subgroup report (one of six reports from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research [ISPOR] Task Force on Good Research Practices-Use of Drug Costs for Cost Effectiveness Analysis [Drug Cost Task Force (DCTF)]) was to review the definition of this perspective, assess its specific application in measuring drug costs, identify any limitations in theory or practice, and make recommendations regarding potential improvements.
METHODS: Key articles, books, and reports in the methodological literature were reviewed, summarized, and integrated into a draft review and report. This draft report was posted for review and comment by ISPOR membership. Numerous comments and suggestions were received, and the report was revised in response to them.
RESULTS: The societal perspective can be defined by three conditions: 1) the inclusion of time costs, 2) the use of opportunity costs, and 3) the use of community preferences. In practice, very few, if any, published CEAs have met all of these conditions, though many claim to have taken a societal perspective. Branded drug costs have typically used actual acquisition cost rather than the much lower social opportunity costs that would reflect only short-run manufacturing and distribution costs. This practice is understandable, pragmatic, and useful to current decision-makers. Nevertheless, this use of CEA focuses on static rather than dynamic efficacy and overlooks the related incentives for innovation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our key recommendation is that current CEA practice acknowledge and embrace this limitation by adopting a new standard for the reference case as one of a "limited societal" or "health systems" perspective, using acquisition drug prices while including indirect costs and community preferences. The field of pharmacoeconomics also needs to acknowledge the limitations of this perspective when it comes to important questions of research and development costs, and incentives for innovation.},

  abstract = {Purpose To compare conventional sibling bone marrow transplantation (CBMT), BMT with alternative donor (ABMT), and chemotherapy (CT) for children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and an early first marrow relapse.   Patients and Methods After informed consent, 214 patients with ALL and early marrow relapse began multiagent induction therapy. One hundred sixty-three patients with fewer than 25\% marrow blasts and count recovery at the end of induction (second remission [CR2]) were allocated by donor availability. Fifty patients with sibling donors were allocated to CBMT. Seventy-two patients were randomly allocated between ABMT and CT while 41 patients refused allocation.   Results Overall, 3-year event free survival from entry is 19\% {$\pm$} 3\%. Thirty-two of 50 CBMT patients (64\%) and 19 of 37 ABMT patients (51\%) underwent transplantation in CR2 with 3-year disease-free survival of 42\% {$\pm$} 7\% and 29\% {$\pm$} 7\%. The 3-year DFS is 29\% {$\pm$} 7\%, 21\% {$\pm$} 7\%, and 27\% {$\pm$} 8\% for patients allocated to CBMT, ABMT, and CT, respectively. Contrary to protocol, 12 of 35 patients allocated to CT underwent BMT in CR2. Of these, five patients died after BMT and 5 patients relapsed.   Conclusion More than one half of patients died, failed reinduction, or relapsed again before 3 months after CR2 (median time to BMT). Intent-to-treat pair-wise comparison of ABMT with CT, CT with CBMT, and CBMT with ABMT yields hazards of 1.2, 1.1, 0.8 with P values of .56, .80, and .36, respectively. Outcomes remain similar and poor for children with ALL and early marrow relapse. BMT is not a complete answer to the challenge of ALL and early marrow relapse.},

In the GADOLIN trial, R/R-rituximab patients who received G plus bendamustine (B) followed by G-monotherapy (G + B) for up to 2 years had significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to patients receiving B-monotherapy. This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of G + B vs B-monotherapy for R/R-rituximab FL patients from a US payer perspective.Materials and methods: Patient outcomes were simulated using a 3-state area under the curve model including progression-free survival, progressive disease, and death. This study used R/R-rituximab data from the National LymphoCare Study to extrapolate the GADOLIN trial's refractory FL progression-free and overall survival data to a R/R-rituximab FL population. Drug utilization and adverse events were based on trial data, and costs were based on Medicare reimbursements and drug wholesale acquisition costs in 2016. Utility estimates were derived from published literature. Post-progression treatment costs were based on observed post-progression therapies in GADOLIN. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess model uncertainty.Results: G + B resulted in an increase in quality-adjusted life years relative to B-monotherapy of 1.24 (95\% CR = 0.61\textendash{}1.87); the incremental total cost was \$58,100 (95\% CR = \$54,500\textendash\$61,500). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \$47,000 per QALY gained, and, based on probabilistic simulations, there was a 98\% probability that G + B was cost-effective at the \$100,000 per QALY threshold.Limitations and conclusions: This US-based analysis suggests that treatment with G + B compared to B-monotherapy is likely cost-effective in R/R-rituximab FL patients. Modeling a R/R-rituximab population based on a synthesis of GADOLIN and the National LymphoCare Study data introduces uncertainty in the analysis. However, the findings were robust to sensitivity analyses.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between June 1998 and August 2002, 114 patients who had received previous chemotherapy for indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated with a standard 4-week course of rituximab. Patients with objective response or stable disease were randomly assigned to receive either maintenance rituximab therapy (standard 4-week courses administered at 6-month intervals) or rituximab re-treatment at the time of lymphoma progression. The duration of rituximab benefit was measured from the date of first rituximab treatment until the date other treatment was required.
RESULTS: Ninety (79\%) of 114 patients had objective response or stable disease after initial rituximab treatment, and were randomly assigned to treatment. Progression-free survival was prolonged in the maintenance group (31.3 v 7.4 months; P = .007). Final overall and complete response rates were higher in the maintenance group. Duration of rituximab benefit was similar in the maintenance and re-treatment groups (31.3 v 27.4 months, respectively). More maintenance patients remain in continuous remission, and more are currently in complete remission. Both treatment approaches were well tolerated.
CONCLUSION: In patients who have objective response or stable disease with single-agent rituximab therapy, duration of rituximab benefit is substantially prolonged with either scheduled maintenance treatment or rituximab re-treatment at the time of progression. At present, the magnitude of benefit with either approach appears similar. However, additional follow-up of this trial is required, and completion of phase III randomized trials is necessary to definitively answer this question.},

  abstract = {Introduction: CTL019 (tisagenlecleucel) is a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T)for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (r/r) pediatric/young adult patients (pts) with B-cellacute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL). Current treatments for r/r pediatric ALL (pALL) include clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), blinatumomab (Blin), other salvage chemotherapies (SC), and allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). The prognosis for r/r pALL is poor and SCT is considered as the only potentially curative option. However, less than 50\% of pts with multiple relapses achieve CR from existing treatments, and even fewer are eligible for and ultimately receive SCT. CTL019 is a potentially promising treatment option for pALL pts with multiple relapses, with complete remission (CR) rates between 69-95\% based on data from phase I/II trials (ELIANA, ENSIGN, and CHP959). The current study aimed to compare the life year (LY) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained using CTL019 vs. comparator treatments, and estimate the value-based prices for CTL019 at different incremental (incr) cost effectiveness ratios (willingness-to-pay [WTP] thresholds) for the treatment of r/r pALL from a US third-party payer perspective. Methods: A partitioned survival model with monthly cycle and 3\% discount rate was developed to assess the incr cost effectiveness of CTL019 compared to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin, SC, and 2nd SCT, for the treatment of r/r pALL over a 20-year time horizon. The model included three health states: event-free survival (EFS), progressive disease, and death. Efficacy inputs (overall survival [OS] and EFS) for CTL019 were based on pooled data of three phase I/II single-arm trials. Efficacy inputs for the comparators were based on publications of clinical trial and SCT registry that enrolled similar pts (although with notable differences); Kaplan-Meier curves of OS and EFS, where available, were used to reconstruct proxy patient-level data. Parametric models were fitted to extrapolate EFS and OS for each treatment until year 5. Afterwards, the model assumed no additional progression, and that all pts alive at 5 years would experience the same mortality risk consistent with long-term survivors of pALL. Pre-treatment (lymphodepleting for CTL019 and induction therapy for SCT) and treatment costs (drug, administration, and hospitalization), adverse event (AE) costs, subsequent SCT costs, and medical costs for each health state were obtained from public databases and literature. All costs were inflated to 2016 USD. Utilities for each health state and disutilities for AEs were based on literature. Incr LY, incr QALY, and incr cost per QALY gained were estimated comparing CTL019 to each comparator. Value-based prices, defined as the price that would achieve the incr cost effectiveness ratios (WTP thresholds) of \$100,000, \$150,000, \$200,000, and, \$300,000 per QALY gained, were calculated for CTL019 vs. each comparator. Deterministic sensitivity analyses (DSA) were performed to test the robustness of the results. Results: Over a 20-year time horizon, treatment with CTL019 led to an increase of 4.62, 3.79, 3.68, 2.08 and 2.05 in discounted LYs and an increase of 4.29, 3.64, 3.64, 2.32 and 2.31 in discounted QALYs relative to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin, SC, and SCT respectively. CTL019 value prices to reach a specified incr cost effectiveness ratio (WTP threshold) of \$150,000/QALY ranged from \$604,289 to \$779,487 across comparators. The value prices ranged between \$951,745 and \$1,364,525 when the incr cost effectiveness ratio (WTP threshold) was set at \$300,000/QALY (Table 1). Results from the DSA generally supported the base case findings, with the largest variation observed when time horizon and the parametric survival functions were varied. Compared to Clo-M, Clo-C, Blin and SC, CTL019 trials enrolled more severe pts who had failed more lines of prior therapies, which suggested that the estimated CTL019 LY and QALY benefits were conservative. Conclusions: Compared to existing treatments, CTL019 showed promisin efficacy results for the treatment of pediatric/young adult ALL pts, with incr QALY gains of 2.31-4.29. Using specified incr cost effectiveness ratios (WTP thresholds) from \$100,000/QALY to \$300,000/QALY, the valuebased prices for CTL019 ranged from \$488,470 to \$1,364,525. (Figure Presented).},

This oversight limits the generalizability of research findings and their applicability to clinical practice, in particular for women but also for men. This article describes the rationale for an international set of guidelines to encourage a more systematic approach to the reporting of sex and gender in research across disciplines. A panel of 13 experts representing nine countries developed the guidelines through a series of teleconferences, conference presentations and a 2-day workshop. An internet survey of 716 journal editors, scientists and other members of the international publishing community was conducted as well as a literature search on sex and gender policies in scientific publishing. The Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) guidelines are a comprehensive procedure for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results and interpretation of findings. The SAGER guidelines are designed primarily to guide authors in preparing their manuscripts, but they are also useful for editors, as gatekeepers of science, to integrate assessment of sex and gender into all manuscripts as an integral part of the editorial process.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) commissioned a 'mock technology appraisal' to assess whether changes to its methods and processes are needed. This report presents the findings of independent research commissioned to inform this appraisal and the deliberations of a panel convened by NICE to evaluate the mock appraisal. METHODS: Our research included reviews to identify issues, analysis methods and conceptual differences and the relevance of alternative decision frameworks, alongside the development of an exemplar case study of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for treating acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. RESULTS: An assessment of previous evaluations of regenerative medicines found that, although there were a number of evidential challenges, none was unique to regenerative medicines or was beyond the scope of existing methods used to conceptualise decision uncertainty. Regarding the clinical evidence for regenerative medicines, the issues were those associated with a limited evidence base but were not unique to regenerative medicines: small non-randomised studies, high variation in response and the intervention subject to continuing development. The relative treatment effects generated from single-arm trials are likely to be optimistic unless it is certain that the historical data have accurately estimated the efficacy of the control agent. Pivotal trials may use surrogate end points, which, on average, overestimate treatment effects. To reduce overall uncertainty, multivariate meta-analysis of all available data should be considered. Incorporating indirectly relevant but more reliable (more mature) data into the analysis can also be considered; such data may become available as a result of the evolving regulatory pathways being developed by the European Medicines Agency. For the exemplar case of CAR T-cell therapy, target product profiles (TPPs) were developed, which considered the 'curative' and 'bridging to stem-cell transplantation' treatment approaches separately. Within each TPP, three 'hypothetical' evidence sets (minimum, intermediate and mature) were generated to simulate the impact of alternative levels of precision and maturity in the clinical evidence. Subsequent assessments of cost-effectiveness were undertaken, employing the existing NICE reference case alongside additional analyses suggested within alternative frameworks. The additional exploratory analyses were undertaken to demonstrate how assessments of cost-effectiveness and uncertainty could be impacted by alternative managed entry agreements (MEAs), including price discounts, performance-related schemes and technology leasing. The panel deliberated on the range of TPPs, evidence sets and MEAs, commenting on the likely recommendations for each scenario. The panel discussed the challenges associated with the exemplar and regenerative medicines more broadly, focusing on the need for a robust quantification of the level of uncertainty in the cost-effective estimates and the potential value of MEAs in limiting the exposure of the NHS to high upfront costs and loss associated with a wrong decision. CONCLUSIONS: It is to be expected that there will be a significant level of uncertainty in determining the clinical effectiveness of regenerative medicines and their long-term costs and benefits, but the existing methods available to estimate the implications of this uncertainty are sufficient. The use of risk sharing and MEAs between the NHS and manufacturers of regenerative medicines should be investigated further.

Among the 25 patients (median age, 14 years; pre-B cell ALL, 84\%; {$\geq$} 2 prior regimens: 84\%; refractory to previous regimen: 60\%), the overall response rate was 44\% (7 CR, 4 CRp) with a 67.3-week median duration or remission censored at last follow-up. Most patients proceeded to alternative therapy, and 10 patients (40\%) received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Six patients (24\%) died because of treatment-related adverse events associated with infection, hepatotoxicity, and/or multiorgan failure. The study protocol was amended to exclude patients with prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after 4 of the first 8 patients developed severe hepatotoxicity suggestive of veno-occlusive disease. No additional cases of veno-occlusive disease occurred. The regimen offered encouraging response rates and sustained remission in R/R patients.

  abstract = {Background
Cancer care is evolving rapidly, and costs and value of new treatments are frequently debated. Up-to-date evidence on the total cost of cancer is needed to inform policy decisions. This study estimates the cost of cancer in Europe in 2018 and extends a previous analysis for 1995\textendash{}2014.
Methods
Cancer-specific health expenditure were derived from national estimates. Data on cancer drug sales were obtained from IQVIA. The productivity loss from premature mortality was estimated from data from Eurostat and the World Health Organization. Estimates of the productivity loss from morbidity and informal care costs were based on previous studies.
Findings
The total cost of cancer was \texteuro{}199 billion in Europe (EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom) in 2018. Total costs ranged from \texteuro{}160 per capita in Romania to \texteuro{}578 in Switzerland (after adjustment for price differentials). Health expenditure on cancer care were \texteuro{}103 billion, of which \texteuro{}32 billion were spent on cancer drugs. Informal care costs were \texteuro{}26 billion. The total productivity loss was \texteuro{}70 billion, composed of \texteuro{}50 billion from premature mortality and \texteuro{}20 billion from morbidity.
Interpretation
Health expenditure on cancer care were of a similar magnitude as the sum of non-health-care costs in 2018. Over the last two decades, health spending on cancer has increased faster than the increase in cancer incidence. The productivity loss from premature mortality has decreased because of reductions in mortality in the working-age population. Trends in informal care costs and productivity loss from morbidity are uncertain because of lack of comparable data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of childhood cancer often results in an altered life situation for the parents, characterized by difficulties regarding work, family and household demands. Previous research shows that parents' work situation and income are impacted, yet, few studies have explored the issue from a longitudinal perspective. This study sought to increase the knowledge about the socio-economic conditions of parents of children with cancer in Sweden by means of a longitudinal assessment of work situation, sick leave, and household income.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of mothers (n = 139) and fathers (n = 138) of children with cancer recruited from 2002 to 2004. Data was collected by telephone interviews at six time points, ranging from the time of diagnosis to one year after the end of treatment.
RESULTS: Findings showed that parents' work situation was most evidently impacted during the child's treatment, when the greatest proportions of non-working and sick-listed parents were found. Compared with the time of diagnosis, fewer mothers worked up to three months after the end of treatment, and more mothers were on sick leave one year after the end of treatment. Although the extent of sick leave among fathers did not differ compared with the time of diagnosis, fewer fathers worked one year after the end of treatment. Household income was significantly reduced during the child's treatment and months thereafter, while income was at an equal level as before the diagnosis for most families one year after the end of treatment.
CONCLUSION: The results offer a unique understanding of how mothers' and fathers' work situation and income are impacted in the short- and long-term, and give guidance on how to improve the comprehensive support given to parents of children with cancer. Socio-economical issues should be emphasized as these may provide targets for policy interventions aiming to reduce parental strain related to work and finances.},

  abstract = {Two modeling approaches are commonly used to estimate the associations between neighborhood characteristics and individual-level health outcomes in multilevel studies (subjects within neighborhoods). Random effects models (or mixed models) use maximum likelihood estimation. Population average models typically use a generalized estimating equation (GEE) approach. These methods are used in place of basic regression approaches because the health of residents in the same neighborhood may be correlated, thus violating independence assumptions made by traditional regression procedures. This violation is particularly relevant to estimates of the variability of estimates. Though the literature appears to favor the mixed-model approach, little theoretical guidance has been offered to justify this choice. In this paper, we review the assumptions behind the estimates and inference provided by these 2 approaches. We propose a perspective that treats regression models for what they are in most circumstances: reasonable approximations of some true underlying relationship. We argue in general that mixed models involve unverifiable assumptions on the data-generating distribution, which lead to potentially misleading estimates and biased inference. We conclude that the estimation-equation approach of population average models provides a more useful approximation of the truth.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of clofarabine, a novel deoxyadenosine analog, in pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).   Patients and Methods In a phase II, open-label, multicenter study, 61 pediatric patients with refractory or relapsed ALL received clofarabine 52 mg/m2 intravenously over 2 hours daily for 5 days, every 2 to 6 weeks. The median age was 12 years (range, 1 to 20 years), and the median number of prior regimens was three (range, two to six regimens).   Results The response rate was 30\%, consisting of seven complete remissions (CR), five CRs without platelet recovery (CRp), and six partial remissions. Remissions were durable enough to allow patients to proceed to hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) after clofarabine. Median CR duration in patients who did not receive HSCT was 6 weeks, with four patients maintaining CR or CRp for 8 weeks or more (8+, 12, 37+, and 48 weeks) on clofarabine therapy alone. The most common adverse events of grade {$\geq$} 3 were febrile neutropenia, anorexia, hypotension, and nausea.   Conclusion Clofarabine is active as a single agent in pediatric patients with multiple relapsed or refractory ALL. The toxicity profile is as expected in this heavily pretreated patient population. Studies exploring rational combinations of clofarabine with other agents are ongoing in an effort to maximize clinical benefit.},

A multicenter seamless design pivotal phase 1 trial of liso-cel in R/R B-NHL (NCT02631044) has enrolled; long-term follow up of the nonpivotal cohort will be presented here. Methods: Pts with R/R DLBCL, PMBCL, FL3B, or MCL and adequate organ function are eligible. Treatment includes lymphodepletion with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, followed by liso-cel. Multiple dose levels (DLs) and administration schedules were evaluated; DL2 (108 CAR T cells) was chosen for the pivotal cohort. The nonpivotal FULL dataset includes all pts in the DLBCL cohort (DLBCL NOS, PMBCL, FL3B) treated with liso-cel at all DLs; CORE dataset includes only pts meeting inclusion criteria for the pivotal cohort, including DLBCL NOS (de novo or transformed from FL) and high grade lymphoma. Study objectives include safety, PK, and antitumor response. Results: As of Oct 9, 2017, 91 pts were treated and evaluable for safety, 88 for efficacy. Pt characteristics were previously reported (Abramson ASH 2017). CRS was seen in 35\% of pts; a single pt (1\%) developed grade 3-4 CRS. Neurotoxicity (NT) developed in 19\% of pts including 12\% grade 3-4; all but one event resolved at time of data snapshot. Median onset of CRS and NT was 5 and 10 days respectively. Nineteen pts (21\%) received tocilizumab and/or dexamethasone. Long term safety, including B cell aplasia, infections, and cytopenias, will be reported. Best ORR in FULL and CORE was 74\% (65/88) and 80\% (52/65), respectively; best CR was 52\% (46/88) in FULL and 55\% (36/65) in CORE. A higher rate of durable response at DL2 was observed in the CORE population, with 6-month ORR and CR of 50\% and 50\% (7/14) vs 40\% (8/20) and 30\% (6/20) at DL1. Long term efficacy, including 6-/12-month follow up from \textasciitilde{}95/\textasciitilde{}55 pts, will be reported. Conclusions: Liso-cel shows durable responses in pts with heavily pretreated R/R DLBCL and trends toward more durable responses at DL2. Observed acute toxicities have been manageable at all DLs tested and long-term safety from the nonpivotal cohort will be reported. Clinical trial information: NCT02631044.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To examine outcome of treatment for patients with recurrent follicular lymphoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred twelve newly diagnosed follicular lymphoma patients were studied. One hundred seventy-nine were initially treated successfully. Recurrent or progressive lymphoma developed in 116. Treatment was given according to disease stage and current protocols, mostly with single alkylating agents. A policy of repeated lymph node and bone marrow biopsy was pursued.
RESULTS: The overall median survival duration was 9 years, with a median follow-up duration of 12 years. Following recurrence, the median survival duration was 4 1/2 years. Only eight of 116 patients with recurrent disease died of causes unrelated to lymphoma. The overall response rate to first re-treatment was 78\% and showed slight decline with successive recurrences, reaching 48\% after the fourth treatment. The median duration of second remission was 13 months, (v 31 months for first remission), with the only significant predictive factor being quality of remission. Multivariate analysis showed only age at recurrence and number of prior treatments to correlate with survival after first recurrence. Survival after second remission was only correlated with age and quality of response: Kaplan-Meier estimates gave 53\% of patients reaching second complete remission alive 10 years later, compared with 28\% in partial remission.
CONCLUSION: Age and previous and continuing responsiveness of follicular lymphoma to therapy are the principal determinants of survival following recurrence. Improvement in survival with new treatments will be demonstrated most readily in older patients, while more intensive approaches should be tested in younger patients in whom remission is achieved with difficulty.},

  abstract = {Introduction: The approval of rituximab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD20, revolutionized the treatment of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and became an undisputed standard of care. However, as with all biologic medicines, the complex development and manufacturing process for rituximab have meant that the medicine attracts high treatment costs. Approved rituximab biosimilars have been comprehensively demonstrated to match the reference medicine. With the potential to increase access to biologic therapy, they have a key role in helping to improve patient outcomes in lymphoma care.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the role of rituximab in the treatment of lymphoma. We explore development and regulatory requirements for biosimilar development and the potential impact of these medicines on access and sustainability. Focusing on biosimilars of rituximab, we examine in detail the evidence for biosimilarity for the two rituximab biosimilars that are approved in Europe and provide an overview of rituximab biosimilars currently in development.Expert opinion: We foresee a wider uptake of biosimilar medicines for lymphoma treatment over the next 5 years. The associated cost savings should be invested in broadening patient access to biological therapies, enabling wider use of more expensive treatment strategies and driving innovation in cancer care.},

Using publicly available data, we estimated mild, moderate, and severe anemia from 1990 to 2010 for 187 countries, both sexes, and 20 age groups. We then performed cause-specific attribution to 17 conditions using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors (GBD) 2010 Study. Global anemia prevalence in 2010 was 32.9\%, causing 68.36 (95\% uncertainty interval [UI], 40.98 to 107.54) million years lived with disability (8.8\% of total for all conditions [95\% UI, 6.3\% to 11.7\%]). Prevalence dropped for both sexes from 1990 to 2010, although more for males. Prevalence in females was higher in most regions and age groups. South Asia and Central, West, and East sub-Saharan Africa had the highest burden, while East, Southeast, and South Asia saw the greatest reductions. Iron-deficiency anemia was the top cause globally, although 10 different conditions were among the top 3 in regional rankings. Malaria, schistosomiasis, and chronic kidney disease-related anemia were the only conditions to increase in prevalence. Hemoglobinopathies made significant contributions in most populations. Burden was highest in children under age 5, the only age groups with negative trends from 1990 to 2010.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Rituximab has significantly improved the prognosis for patients with both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. An economic evaluation was carried out to assess the cost-effectiveness in Sweden of rituximab as maintenance therapy for patients with follicular lymphoma in remission after second line therapy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The incremental cost and effectiveness of rituximab maintenance therapy versus observation were evaluated in a health-state transition model. Primary effect measures were quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) and life-years gained (LYG). Model state transitions were calculated based on progression-free and overall survival data from the EORTC20981 trial. The analysis was made from the perspective of the healthcare provider, including direct medical costs presented in euro, 2007 value. Effects and costs were discounted at a 3\% annual rate. The stability of the base case results were tested in one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses.
RESULTS: The evaluation assessed rituximab maintenance therapy to be associated with an incremental cost per QALY gained of euro 12,600 and an incremental cost per LYG of euro 11,200. The average discounted life expectancy for patients on rituximab maintenance was 1.0 year longer than for patients on observation (5.96 vs. 4.94 years). Rituximab maintenance was associated with an additional 0.9 QALY, and total costs per patient were euro 11,500 higher in the treatment arm, compared to observation.
DISCUSSION: The results indicate that rituximab maintenance treatment after successful induction therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma in Sweden is cost-effective compared to observation.},

  abstract = {Survival among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 15 to 39 with cancer has not improved to the same extent as that of pediatric and older adult cancer patients, which is thought to relate, in part, to the lower participation of AYAs in clinical trials. Because significant efforts have been made to improve clinical trial enrollment for AYAs, we (1) present contemporary clinical trial enrollment rates by cancer type, sociodemographic characteristics, and treatment setting and (2) discuss provider-, patient-, and system-level barriers to clinical trial participation. Contemporary studies examining clinical trial enrollment among AYAs have continued to find low overall participation relative to pediatric populations, with most studies observing no significant improvements in enrollment over time. In addition to age and cancer type, enrollment varies by treatment setting, health insurance, and race/ethnicity. Access to available clinical trials may be increased by appropriate referral of AYAs to pediatric and adult specialty cancer centers with studies relevant to the AYA population because most AYAs are treated in the community setting. Even with similar access to trials, however, AYAs may be less likely to participate, and therefore, future efforts should focus on better understanding and addressing barriers to enrollment as well as improving education and outreach regarding clinical trials.},

On average, each year, 15 000 new cases of FL are diagnosed in the United States alone. Despite dramatic improvements worldwide in the treatment of FL, such as the emergence of anti-CD20 agents, FL cannot be cured yet. There is no widely agreed standard of care for the first line therapy of FL. Current options include ``watch and wait'' strategies, rituximab monotherapy, multi-drug therapy of rituximab and bendamustine or CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisones), or combinations with the new anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab. Even with average of 80\% response rate to initial therapy 20\% of patients relapse within 2 years and there is no clear consensus on further management. However, a diverse set of new drugs with different mechanisms of action are available in a relapse setting. These drugs have extended overall survival (OS) up to 12 years. An indolent course of FL is manifested by varying periods of remissions and relapses that can potentially progress to transformation into either other hematologic malignancy (eg, DLBCL) or become chemo-refractory. Considering the chronic nature of FL, physicians should strive for both efficacy of treatment and possible extended-length remissions, and for good patient quality of life and limited toxicity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Despite improvements in treatment, approximately 20\% of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experience relapse and do poorly. The Therapeutic Advances in Childhood Leukemia (TACL) Consortium was assembled to assess novel drugs for children with resistant leukemia. We hypothesize that novel agents and combinations that fail to improve baseline complete remission rates in comparable populations are unlikely to contribute to better outcomes and should be abandoned. We sought to define response rates and disease-free survival (DFS) rates in patients treated at TACL institutions, which could serve as a comparator for future studies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort review of patients with relapsed and refractory ALL previously treated at TACL institutions between the years of 1995 and 2004. Data regarding initial and relapsed disease characteristics, disease response, and survival were collected and compared with those of published reports. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) rates (mean +/- SE) were 83\% +/- 4\% for early first marrow relapse, 93\% +/- 3\% for late first marrow relapse, 44\% +/- 5\% for second marrow relapse, and 27\% +/- 6\% for third marrow relapse. Five-year DFS rates in CR2 and CR3 were 27\% +/- 4\% and 15\% +/- 7\% respectively. CONCLUSION: We generally confirm a 40\% CR rate for second and subsequent relapse, but our remission rate for early first relapse seems better than that reported in the literature (83\% v approximately 70\%). Our data may allow useful modeling of an expected remission rate for any population of patients who experience relapse.},

  abstract = {Despite risk-adapted treatment, survival of children with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor compared with that of patients with initial diagnosis of ALL. Leukemia-associated genetic alterations may provide novel prognostic factors to refine present relapse treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of 13 recurrent genetic alterations in 204 children treated uniformly for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. The most common alterations were deletions of CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, fusion of ETV6-RUNX1 and deletions and/or mutations of TP53. Multivariate analysis identified IKZF1 deletion and TP53 alteration as independent predictors of inferior outcome (P=0.002 and P=0.001). Next, we investigated how both alterations can improve the established risk stratification in relapsed ALL. Intermediate-risk relapse patients with low minimal residual disease are currently considered to have a good prognosis. In this group, deletion of IKZF1 and alteration of TP53 identify patients with significantly inferior outcome (P{$<$}0.001). In high-risk relapse patients, deletion of IKZF1 is strongly predictive of a second relapse after stem cell transplantation (P{$<$}0.001). We conclude that IKZF1 and TP53 represent relevant prognostic factors that should be considered in future risk assessment of children with relapsed ALL to indicate treatment intensification or intervention.},

  abstract = {Productivity costs occur when the productivity of individuals is affected by illness, treatment, disability or premature death. The objective of this paper was to review past and current developments related to the inclusion, identification, measurement and valuation of productivity costs in economic evaluations. The main debates in the theory and practice of economic evaluations of health technologies described in this review have centred on the questions of whether and how to include productivity costs, especially productivity costs related to paid work. The past few decades have seen important progress in this area. There are important sources of productivity costs other than absenteeism (e.g. presenteeism and multiplier effects in co-workers), but their exact influence on costs remains unclear. Different measurement instruments have been developed over the years, but which instrument provides the most accurate estimates has not been established. Several valuation approaches have been proposed. While empirical research suggests that productivity costs are best included in the cost side of the cost-effectiveness ratio, the jury is still out regarding whether the human capital approach or the friction cost approach is the most appropriate valuation method to do so. Despite the progress and the substantial amount of scientific research, a consensus has not been reached on either the inclusion of productivity costs in economic evaluations or the methods used to produce productivity cost estimates. Such a lack of consensus has likely contributed to ignoring productivity costs in actual economic evaluations and is reflected in variations in national health economic guidelines. Further research is needed to lessen the controversy regarding the estimation of health-related productivity costs. More standardization would increase the comparability and credibility of economic evaluations taking a societal perspective.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Measuring utility for cost-utility analysis (CUA) is challenging in children. The objectives were to characterize pediatric CUAs, appraise their quality, and identify determinants of higher quality.
METHODS: Descriptive data were imported from the PEDE database for 305 pediatric CUAs published from 1997 to 2009, and quality was rated using the Pediatric Quality Appraisal Questionnaire (PQAQ) in 213 studies. The impact on quality of publication year, journal type, and whether utility was measured was analyzed using multiple regression.
RESULTS: CUAs increased over time and the largest proportion was from North America (38\%). Children aged 1-12~years (39\%) and preventative interventions (51\%) were studied most frequently. Whereas a societal perspective was most common in papers published before 2007 (49\%), a third-party payer perspective was subsequently most frequent (63\%). Utility was measured prospectively in 8\% of studies. Domains that demonstrated the poorest quality were Perspective, Costs and resource use, Outcomes, Analysis, Incremental analysis and Conflict of interest. Quality increased significantly over time for most domains and was greater in studies published in methods/health economic journals.
CONCLUSIONS: The quality of pediatric CUAs is increasing. Few studies ascertain utility prospectively, suggesting the need for better instruments for pediatric health state valuation and measurement.},

  abstract = {Background. A common feature of most reviews or catalogues of health utilities has been their focus on adult health states or derivation of values from adult populations. More generally, utility measurement in or on behalf of children has been constrained by several methodological concerns. The objective of this study was to conduct the first comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of primary utility data for childhood conditions and descriptors, and to determine the effects of methodological factors on childhood utilities. Methods. The review followed PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, EconLit, CINAHL and Cochrane Library were searched for primary studies reporting health utilities for childhood conditions or descriptors using direct or indirect valuation methods. The Paediatric Economic Database Evaluation (PEDE) Porject was also searched for cost-utility analyses with primary utility values. Mean or median utilities for each of the main samples were catalogued, and weighted averages of utilities for each health condition were estimated, by valuation method. Mixed-effects meta-regression using hierarchical linear modeling was conducted for the most common valuation methods to estimate the utility decrement for each health condition category relative to general childhood population health, as well as the independent effects of methodological factors. Results. The literature searches resulted in 272 eligible studies. These yielded 3,414 utilities when all sub-groups were considered, covering all ICD-10 chapters relevant to childhood health, 19 valuation methods, 12 respondent types, 8 modes of administration, and data from 36 countries. A total of 1,191 utility values were obtained when only main study samples were considered, and these were catalogued by health condition or descriptor, and methodological characteristics. 1,073 mean utilities for main samples were used for fixed-effects meta-analysis by health condition and valuation method. Mixed-effects meta-regressions estimated that 53 of 76 ICD-10 delineated health conditions, valued using the HUI3, were associated with statistically significant utility decrements relative to general population health, whereas 38 of 57 valued using a visual analog scale (VAS) were associated with statistically significant VAS decrements. For both methods, parental proxy assessment was associated with overestimation of values, whereas adolescents reported lower values than children under 12 y. VAS responses were more heavily influenced by mode of administration than the HUI3. Conclusion. Utilities and their associated distributions, as well as the independent contributions of methodological factors, revealed by this systematic review and meta-analysis can inform future economic evaluations within the childhood context.},

MRD for the bcl-2/IgH translocation was determined on bone marrow cells in a centralized laboratory belonging to the Euro-MRD consortium, using qualitative and quantitative polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). Of 234 enrolled patients, 227 (97\%) were screened at diagnosis. A molecular marker (MM) was found in 51\%. Patients with an MM were monitored at 8 subsequent times. Of the 675 expected follow-up samples, 83\% were analyzed. Conversion to PCR negativity predicted better progression-free survival (PFS) at all post-treatment times (eg, end of therapy: 3-year PFS, 72\% vs 39\%; P {$<$} .007). MRD was predictive in both maintenance (83\% vs 60\%; P {$<$} .007) and observation (71\% vs 50\%; P {$<$} .001) groups. PCR positivity at the end of induction was an independent adverse predictor (hazard ratio, 3.1; 95\% confidence interval, 1.36-7.07). MRD is a powerful independent outcome predictor in FL patients who receive rituximab-intensive programs, suggesting a need to investigate its value for decision-making.

  abstract = {This paper investigated educational achievement, employment status, living situation, marital status and offspring in 500 Dutch long-term young adults survivors of childhood cancer (age range, 16\textendash{}49 years, 47\% female). The results were compared with a reference group of 1092 persons with no history of cancer (age range, 15\textendash{}33 years, 55\% female). The impact of demographic and medical characteristics on psychosocial adjustment was studied. All participants completed a self\textendash{}report questionnaire. The results showed that, although many survivors are functioning well and leading normal lives, a subgroup of survivors were less likely to complete high-school, to attain an advanced graduate degree, to follow normal elementary or secondary school and had to be enrolled more often on learning disabled programs. The percentage of employed survivors was lower than the percentage of employed controls in the comparison group, but more survivors were student or homemaker. Survivors had lower rates of marriage and parenthood, and worried more about their fertility and the risk of their children having cancer. Survivors, especially males, lived more often with their parents. Cranial irradiation dose {$\leq$}25 Gy was an important independent prognostic factor of lower educational achievement. Survivors with a history of brain/CNS tumours had a higher risk of being single than survivors with a diagnosis of leukaemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These results indicate that important aspects of life are affected in a substantial number of persons who have been diagnosed with cancer during childhood or adolescence.

  abstract = {Objectives
To estimate the daily cost of intensive care unit (ICU) stays via micro-costing.
Methods
A multicentre, prospective, observational, cost analysis study was carried out among 21 out of 23 French ICUs randomly selected from French National Hospitals. Each ICU randomly enrolled 5 admitted adult patients with a simplified acute physiology II score {$\geq$} 15 and with at least one major intensive care medical procedure. All health-care human resources used by each patient over a 24-hour period were recorded, as well as all medications, laboratory analyses, investigations, tests, consumables and administrative expenses. All resource costs were estimated from the hospital's perspective (reference year 2009) based on unitary cost data.
Results
One hundred and four patients were included (mean age: 62.3{$\pm$}14.9 years, mean SAPS II: 51.5{$\pm$}16.1, mean SOFA on the study day: 6.9{$\pm$}4.3). Over 24hours, 29 to 186 interventions per patient were performed by different caregivers, leading to a mean total time spent for patient care of 13:32{$\pm$}05:00h. The total daily cost per patient was \texteuro{}1425{$\pm\euro$}520 (95\% CI=\texteuro{}1323 to \texteuro{}1526). ICU human resources represented 43\% of total daily cost. Patient-dependent expenses (\texteuro{}842{$\pm\euro$}521) represented 59\% of the total daily cost. The total daily cost was correlated with the daily SOFA score (r=0.271, P=0.006) and the bedside-time given by caregivers (r=0.716, P{$<$}0.0001).
Conclusion
The average cost of one day of ICU care in French National Hospitals is strongly correlated with the duration of bedside-care carried out by human resources.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma typically respond well to first-line immunochemotherapy. At relapse, single-agent rituximab is commonly administered. Data suggest the immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide could increase the activity of rituximab. METHODS A phase III, multicenter, randomized trial of lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab was conducted in patients with relapsed and/or refractory follicular or marginal zone lymphoma. Patients received lenalidomide or placebo for 12 cycles plus rituximab once per week for 4 weeks in cycle 1 and day 1 of cycles 2 through 5. The primary end point was progression-free survival per independent radiology review. RESULTS A total of 358 patients were randomly assigned to lenalidomide plus rituximab (n = 178) or placebo plus rituximab (n = 180). Infections (63\% v 49\%), neutropenia (58\% v 23\%), and cutaneous reactions (32\% v 12\%) were more common with lenalidomide plus rituximab. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia (50\% v 13\%) and leukopenia (7\% v 2\%) were higher with lenalidomide plus rituximab; no other grade 3 or 4 adverse event differed by 5\% or more between groups. Progression-free survival was significantly improved for lenalidomide plus rituximab versus placebo plus rituximab, with a hazard ratio of 0.46 (95\% CI, 0.34 to 0.62; P {$<$} .001) and median duration of 39.4 months (95\% CI, 22.9 months to not reached) versus 14.1 months (95\% CI, 11.4 to 16.7 months), respectively. CONCLUSION Lenalidomide improved efficacy of rituximab in patients with recurrent indolent lymphoma, with an acceptable safety profile.},

  abstract = {Objective
Well-established cancer registries that routinely link to death registrations can estimate prevalence directly by counting patients alive at a particular point in time (observed prevalence). Such direct methods can only provide prevalence for the years over which the registry has been operational. Time-defined estimates, including 5- and 10-year prevalence, may however underestimate the total cancer burden, and compared with other cancers, there is a lack of accurate information on the total prevalence of hematological malignancy subtypes. Accordingly, we aimed to estimate prevalence (observed and total prevalence) of hematological malignancies and precursor conditions by clinically meaningful subtypes using data from the UK's specialist population-based register, the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (www.hmrn.org).

Methods
Observed and total prevalences were estimated from 15,810 new diagnoses of hematological malignancies from 2004 to 2011 and followed up to the 31 August 2011 (index data). Observed prevalence was calculated by the counting method, and a method based on modelling incidence and survival was used to estimate total prevalence. Estimates were made according to current disease classification for the HMRN region and for the UK.

Results
The overall observed and total prevalence rates were 281.9 and 548.8 per 100,000, respectively; the total number of observed and total prevalent cases in the UK was estimated as 165,841 and 327,818 cases, as expected variation existed by disease subtype reflecting the heterogeneity in underlying disease incidence, survival and age distribution of hematological cancers.

Conclusions
This study demonstrates the importance of estimating `total' prevalence rather than `observed' prevalence by current disease classification (ICD-O-3), particularly for subtypes that have a more indolent nature and for those that are curable. Importantly, these analyses demonstrate that relying on observed prevalence alone would result in a significant underestimation of the relative burden of some subtypes. While many of these cases may be considered cured and no longer being actively treated, people in this survivorship phase may have long-term medical needs and accordingly, it is important to provide accurate counts to allow for healthcare planning.},

  abstract = {Purpose The anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel was recently approved to treat relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With a one-time infusion cost of \$475,000, tisagenlecleucel is currently the most expensive oncologic therapy. We aimed to determine whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective compared with currently available treatments. Methods Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% discount rate). Results With an assumption of a 40\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost \$61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive (\$151,000/QALY gained). At a 0\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisa-genlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost \$184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to \$200,000 or \$350,000 would allow it to meet a \$100,000/QALY or \$150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. Conclusion The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds. Price reductions would favorably influence cost effectiveness even if long-term clinical outcomes are modest.},

  abstract = {Objective: Studies have shown that a proportion of patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) treated with standard chemotherapy will have long-term life expectancy comparable to those in the age-adjusted general population. This systematic literature review summarizes current literature regarding health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of long-term ( 2 years) survivors of aggressive NHL.
Methods: Electronic databases (without restriction on years) and abstracts from four major oncology and HRQoL conferences from 2014 to 2017 were searched. Studies were included if HRQoL or health utility was assessed at least 2 years after NHL diagnosis. Studies focusing on central nervous system lymphoma, or indolent NHL, were excluded. Results were categorized relative to baseline (improvement, deterioration or no change) and compared to the general population (better, comparable or worse).
Results: Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Twelve studies included  1 HRQoL instrument, and two measured health utilities using EQ-5D. Half of the studies showed improvement (5/10) and half no change (5/10) in overall HRQoL. Compared to the general population, overall HRQoL was more comparable when assessed at  3 years from baseline (3/3 better or comparable) versus assessment at {$<$}3 years (2/3 better or comparable). Six studies reported on the physical HRQoL domain with improvement in 4/6 studies and no change in 2/6 studies.
Conclusions: HRQoL of NHL survivors may improve from baseline and becomes more comparable to general population HRQoL with longer survival. Overall HRQoL improvement is driven mostly by improvements in the physical domain.},

  abstract = {Purpose The anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel was recently approved to treat relapsed or refractory pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. With a one-time infusion cost of \$475,000, tisagenlecleucel is currently the most expensive oncologic therapy. We aimed to determine whether tisagenlecleucel is cost effective compared with currently available treatments. Methods Markov modeling was used to evaluate tisagenlecleucel in pediatric relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. The model was informed by recent multicenter, single-arm clinical trials. Tisagenlecleucel (under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness) was compared with blinatumomab, clofarabine combination therapy (clofarabine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide), and clofarabine monotherapy. Scenario and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore uncertainty. Main outcomes were life-years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% discount rate). Results With an assumption of a 40\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 12.1 years and cost \$61,000/QALY gained. However, at a 20\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate, life-expectancies were more modest (3.8 years) and expensive (\$151,000/QALY gained). At a 0\% 5-year relapse-free survival rate and with use as a bridge to transplant, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancies by 5.7 years and cost \$184,000/QALY gained. Reduction of the price of tisagenlecleucel to \$200,000 or \$350,000 would allow it to meet a \$100,000/QALY or \$150,000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold in all scenarios. Conclusion The long-term effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel is a critical but uncertain determinant of its cost effectiveness. At its current price, tisagenlecleucel represents reasonable value if it can keep a substantial fraction of patients in remission without transplantation; however, if all patients ultimately require a transplantation to remain in remission, it will not be cost effective at generally accepted thresholds. Price reductions would favorably influence cost effectiveness even if long-term clinical outcomes are modest.},

  abstract = {PURPOSETwo anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies are approved for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) and tisagenlecleucel; each costs \$373,000. We evaluated their cost effectiveness.METHODSWe used a decision analytic Markov model informed by recent multicenter, single-arm trials to evaluate axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel in multiply relapsed/refractory, adult, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma from a US health payer perspective over a lifetime horizon. Under a range of plausible long-term effectiveness assumptions, each therapy was compared with salvage chemoimmunotherapy regimens and stem-cell transplantation. Main outcomes were undiscounted life years, discounted lifetime costs, discounted quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (3\% annual discount rate). Sensitivity analyses explored uncertainty.RESULTSIn an optimistic scenario, assuming a 40\% 5-year progression-free survival (PFS), axi-cel increased life expectancy by 8.2 years at \$129,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$90,000 to \$219,000). At a 30\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were more modest (6.4 years) and expensive (\$159,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$284,000]). In an optimistic scenario, assuming a 35\% 5-year PFS, tisagenlecleucel increased life expectancy by 4.6 years at \$168,000/QALY gained (95\% uncertainty interval, \$105,000 to \$414,000/QALY). At a 25\% 5-year PFS, improvements in life expectancy were smaller (3.4 years) and more expensive (\$223,000/QALY gained [95\% uncertainty interval, \$123,000 to \$1,170,000/QALY]). Administering CAR-T to all indicated patients would increase US health care costs by approximately \$10 billion over 5 years. Price reductions to \$250,000 and \$200,000, respectively, or payment only for initial complete response (at current prices) would allow axi-cel and tisagenlecleucel to cost less than \$150,000/QALY, even at 25\% PFS.CONCLUSIONAt 2018 prices, it is possible that both CAR-T therapies meet a less than \$150,000/QALY threshold. This depends on long-term outcomes compared with chemoimmunotherapy and stem-cell transplantation, which are uncertain. Widespread adoption would substantially increase non-Hodgkin lymphoma health care costs. Price reductions or payment for initial response would improve cost effectiveness, even with modest long-term outcomes.},

  abstract = {8049  Background: The National LymphoCare Study (NLCS) collects data on disease presentation, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes for 2736 patients with with follicular lymphoma diagnosed 2004-2007 in the USA. Patterns of initial management (Rx1) in this cohort were reported previously (Friedberg, JCO 2009). The current report describes patterns of second-line therapy (Rx2). Methods: Data from pts enrolled in NLCS with a diagnosis of FL and active Rx1 were analyzed to establish patterns of Rx2. Therapy after initial period of observation is considered Rx1 for this analysis. Results: Of 2736 pts enrolled, 1841 remain in active follow-up after median 4.9 years and 991 had received Rx2 with median TTRx2 from Rx1 of 11.1 mos. 325 began Rx2 within six months of beginning Rx1, and 521 within a year. Thus far, 252 pts have begun Rx2 {$>$} 2 yrs following Rx1. 89\% of Rx2 were for progressive disease, 10\% toxicity, and 1\% both. Seventy-one (7.3\%) of the 991 received XRT monotherapy, 62 (6.3\%) received therapy as part of a clinical trial and the rest received systemic therapy \textendash{} most frequently rituximab plus chemotherapy (36.1\%, median TTRx2 9.1mos) and rituximab monotherapy (32.4\%, median TTRx2 14.1mos). 82 pts received chemotherapy alone, 33 received radioimmunotherapy, and 15 underwent BMT as part of Rx2. Among 461 pts receiving non-investigational chemotherapy, 154 received an anthracycline (median TTRx2 6.4 mos), 270 did not (median TTRx2 9.5mos) and 37 had incomplete data. After Rx2, 61\% of pts remained anthracycline naive. Of pts who received investigational therapy as Rx2, 25.8\% had received investigational therapy as Rx1, compared to 6.2\% for the remaining Rx2 groups. Conclusions: Among the first half of NLCS pts who have received Rx2, a few notable patterns emerge: R-monotherapy is utilized more frequently as Rx2 than as Rx1; rituximab is again utilized frequently as part of Rx2, even when TTRX2 is short, presumably representing rituximab resistance by common definitions; and most pts remain anthracycline na\"ive. These data give some clarity to the characteristics of pts available for clinical research in the relapsed/refractory setting of FL, although patterns may change as pts who have longer interval to Rx2 are included over time.},

Compared to white, the other had a worse 5-year overall survival (OS); however, factors including age, race, socioeconomic status, and stage associated with OS showed no significant difference among ethnic groups; thus, biology factors should be explored to explain the racial difference in OS.In conclusion, our findings revealed diversities in demographic features and prognosis among different racial groups.},

Minimal residual disease (MRD) detection by polymerase chain reaction-based methods is routinely employed in the management of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Current knowledge indicates that it is also a useful prognostic tool in several mature lymphoproliferative disorders and particularly in follicular lymphoma (FL). Based on this evidence clinical trials employing MRD-based risk stratification are currently ongoing in FL. In this review the `state of the art' of MRD evaluation in FL is discussed. A short description of technical issues and recent methodological advances is provided. Then, the bulk of the review focuses on critical take-home messages for clinicians working in the field. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of MRD detection and more generally outcome prediction in FL.},

The ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase protein cereblon (CRBN) has been identified as the primary teratogenic target of thalidomide. Our studies demonstrate that thalidomide, lenalidomide and another immunomodulatory drug, pomalidomide, bound endogenous CRBN and recombinant CRBN-DNA damage binding protein-1 (DDB1) complexes. CRBN mediated antiproliferative activities of lenalidomide and pomalidomide in myeloma cells, as well as lenalidomide- and pomalidomide-induced cytokine production in T cells. Lenalidomide and pomalidomide inhibited autoubiquitination of CRBN in HEK293T cells expressing thalidomide-binding competent wild-type CRBN, but not thalidomide-binding defective CRBN(YW/AA). Overexpression of CRBN wild-type protein, but not CRBN(YW/AA) mutant protein, in KMS12 myeloma cells, amplified pomalidomide-mediated reductions in c-myc and IRF4 expression and increases in p21(WAF-1) expression. Long-term selection for lenalidomide resistance in H929 myeloma cell lines was accompanied by a reduction in CRBN, while in DF15R myeloma cells resistant to both pomalidomide and lenalidomide, CRBN protein was undetectable. Our biophysical, biochemical and gene silencing studies show that CRBN is a proximate, therapeutically important molecular target of lenalidomide and pomalidomide.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ongoing monitoring of late mortality among survivors of a childhood or adolescent cancer is essential to appropriately evaluate risk in more recent cohorts and with longer follow-up. We examined overall and cause-specific mortality in a population-based cohort of 2,354 individuals diagnosed with a cancer or tumor prior to 20 years of age between 1970 and 1995 in British Columbia (BC), Canada who survived at least 5 years.
PROCEDURE: Late deaths in a survivor cohort ascertained from the BC Cancer Registry were identified using death registrations. Standardized mortality ratios, absolute excess risk of death, and cumulative risk of death were determined. Demographic, temporal, and disease-related factors in risk of late mortality were also assessed.
RESULTS: After 24,491 person-years of follow-up, there were 181 deaths, 139 of which were cancer related. Excess risk of late mortality among survivors was 7 deaths per 1,000 person-years at risk (AER = 6.6). Standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was ninefold higher relative to the underlying BC population (SMR = 9.1, 95\% CI, 7.8-10.5), and was greatest for those with a recurrence within 5 years of diagnosis, and for those diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and nervous system tumors. Absolute excess risk of late death was significantly higher for males and for those diagnosed prior to 1980, but did not vary according to age at diagnosis. Relative mortality was significantly increased due to cancer-related causes of death (SMR = 81.7, 95\% CI, 68.6-95.8), as well as circulatory (SMR = 9.7, 95\% CI, 4.2-19.1) and respiratory (SMR = 16.8, 95\% CI, 4.6-43.0) diseases.
CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based cohort with long follow-up, there continues to be excess late mortality among childhood and adolescent cancer survivors due to both cancer and non-cancer causes, even among more recently diagnosed survivors.},

  abstract = {Biological products for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis usually are cost effective for healthcare systems in Europe, but they are huge financial burden due to the high number of patients and the significant budget impact. The expected saving from introduction on the market of biosimilars are significant and are linked to better access and affordability. The aim of this study was to conduct comparative price analysis of biological products for rheumatoid arthritis therapy among seventeen EU countries. The point of view is that of the Bulgarian pricing and reimbursement system and the chosen countries are those from external reference basket for prices comparison at manufacturing level. All authorized biological products by EMA with therapeutic indication rheumatoid arthritis were selected. The access for treatment is evaluated as the availability of the product on the market and the prices level. We assessed the availability of all trade names in the price lists of the observed countries. The prices data was obtained from the official web pages of the responsible institutions up to date December 2017. The results show that four out of all six INNs have authorized biosimilars in EMA. Despite its earlier authorization biosimilar adalimumab is not present in any of the price lists of countries. From all eighteen countries only in Lithuania and Estonia there were no published prices of any of the selected medicinal products. Countries with higher number of biosimilar prices are Spain and France. Differences in manufacturers' prices of reference biological products in selected countries in comparison with the lowest manufacturer price are higher with 22 to 69\% while the retail prices between 62 and 95\%. Differences are mostly notable for rituximab, and less notable for tocilizumab. Manufacturers' and retail prices of biosimilar products were established only for three INNs (etanercept, rituximab, and infliximab). Manufacturers' prices differ between 26 and 75\%, while retail prices differ between 40 and 92\% for biosimilars. Comparison of the differences between manufacturer prices of reference biological product and biosimilars shows 36\% difference for etanercept, 39\% for rituximab, and 31\% for infliximab, while at retail level the differences are 11, 86, and 143\%, respectively. The limitation of the study is that the prices are the official ones without discounts due to confidentiality and the real prices may be lower. The second limitation is that the methodology for pricing differs in the countries and this could also influence the prices on both levels (manufacturer and retail). Introduction of biosimilars on the national markets led to significant decrease in reimbursed prices paid by public funds and thus might benefit the patients' access to biological therapy. The decrease of prices after biosimilars entrance on the market is not as notable as for commodity generics.},

  abstract = {The combination of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (CVP) is one of several standard treatment options for advanced follicular lymphoma. This, like similar chemotherapeutic regimens, induces response rates of 60\% to 80\%, with a median response duration of under 2 years. Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody against CD20, is active in follicu-lar lymphoma, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. Previously untreated patients with stages III to IV follicular lymphoma were randomly assigned to receive either 8 cycles of CVP plus rituximab (R-CVP; n 162) or CVP (n 159). Overall and complete response rates were 81\% and 41\% in the R-CVP arm versus 57\% and 10\% in the CVP arm, respectively (P {$<$} .0001). At a median follow up of 30 months, patients treated with R-CVP had a very significantly prolonged time to progression (median 32 months versus 15 months for CVP; P {$<$} .0001). Median time to treatment failure was 27 months in patients receiving R-CVP and 7 months in the CVP arm (P {$<$} .0001). Rituximab did not add significantly to the toxicity of CVP. The addition of rituximab to the CVP regimen significantly improves the clinical outcome in patients with previously untreated advanced follicular lymphoma, without increased toxicity.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is difficult to treat despite the availability of aggressive therapies. Chimeric antigen receptor\textendash{}modified T cells targeting CD19 may overcome many limitations of conventional therapies and induce remission in patients with refractory disease.
METHODS We infused autologous T cells transduced with a CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CTL019) lentiviral vector in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL at doses of 0.76\texttimes{}106 to 20.6\texttimes{}106 CTL019 cells per kilogram of body weight. Patients were monitored for a response, toxic effects, and the expansion and persistence of circulating CTL019 T cells.
RESULTS A total of 30 children and adults received CTL019. Complete remission was achieved in 27 patients (90\%), including 2 patients with blinatumomab-refractory disease and 15 who had undergone stem-cell transplantation. CTL019 cells proliferated in vivo and were detectable in the blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid of patients who had a response. Sustained remission was achieved with a 6-month event-free survival rate of 67\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 51 to 88) and an overall survival rate of 78\% (95\% CI, 65 to 95). At 6 months, the probability that a patient would have persistence of CTL019 was 68\% (95\% CI, 50 to 92) and the probability that a patient would have relapse-free B-cell aplasia was 73\% (95\% CI, 57 to 94). All the patients had the cytokine-release syndrome. Severe cytokine-release syndrome, which developed in 27\% of the patients, was associated with a higher disease burden before infusion and was effectively treated with the anti\textendash{}interleukin-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab.

  abstract = {3011Background: Targeted immunotherapy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells can produce potent anti-tumor responses. We previously reported complete remissions (CR) and prolonged persistence in children and adults with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with CD19-specific CART cells (CTL019). We now report on outcomes and longer follow-up of 59 children with r/r ALL. Methods: T cells collected from the patient were transduced with a lentiviral vector encoding a CAR composed of anti-CD19 scFv, CD3z, and 4-1BB domains, activated/expanded ex vivo with anti-CD3/CD28 beads, and then infused at a dose of 107 to 108cells/kg with a transduction efficiency of 2.3-45\%. 54/59 patients received lymphodepleting chemotherapy the week prior to cell infusion. Results: Of 59 patients aged 20mo-24y with CD19+ ALL, 44 had detectable disease prior to CTL019 cell infusion, while 15 were MRD-. 39 were treated for relapse after prior stem cell transplant (SCT). 15 patients had CNS disease within a year of infusion. At assessment 1 month after infusion, 55/59 (93\%) were in CR. MRD {$<$} 0.01\% by flow cytometry was achieved in 52 patients. CTL019 cells were detected in the CSF and no CNS relapses have been seen. With median follow-up 12 mo (1-43 mo), 34 patients had ongoing CR, with only 6 receiving subsequent therapy (5 SCT, 1 donor lymphocyte infusion), RFS was 76\% (95\% CI, 65-89\%) at 6 mo and 55\% at 12 mo (95\% CI, 42-73\%), and OS was 79\% (95\% CI, 69-91\%) at 12 mo. 20 patients subsequently relapsed, 13 with CD19- disease. CTL019 persistence was accompanied by B cell aplasia, which continued up to last assessment (1-39 mo) in 24/34 patients with ongoing CR. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was seen in 88\% of patients. Severe CRS requiring hemodynamic or respiratory support occurred in 27\%, was associated with high disease burden, and was reversed with the anti-IL6R agent tocilizumab. We could predict development of severe CRS through regression modeling using IFN{$\gamma$}, sgp130, and sIL1RA measured in the first 72h (sens 86\%, spec 89\%, AUC 0.93). Conclusions: Single-agent CTL019 immunotherapy can induce durable responses with control of CNS disease in patients with r/r ALL. Clinical trial information: NCT01626495.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In a single-center phase 1\textendash{}2a study, the anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy tisagenlecleucel produced high rates of complete remission and was associated with serious but mainly reversible toxic effects in children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
METHODS We conducted a phase 2, single-cohort, 25-center, global study of tisagenlecleucel in pediatric and young adult patients with CD19+ relapsed or refractory B-cell ALL. The primary end point was the overall remission rate (the rate of complete remission or complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery) within 3 months.
RESULTS For this planned analysis, 75 patients received an infusion of tisagenlecleucel and could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall remission rate within 3 months was 81\%, with all patients who had a response to treatment found to be negative for minimal residual disease, as assessed by means of flow cytometry. The rates of event-free survival and overall survival were 73\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 60 to 82) and 90\% (95\% CI, 81 to 95), respectively, at 6 months and 50\% (95\% CI, 35 to 64) and 76\% (95\% CI, 63 to 86) at 12 months. The median duration of remission was not reached. Persistence of tisagenlecleucel in the blood was observed for as long as 20 months. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that were suspected to be related to tisagenlecleucel occurred in 73\% of patients. The cytokine release syndrome occurred in 77\% of patients, 48\% of whom received tocilizumab. Neurologic events occurred in 40\% of patients and were managed with supportive care, and no cerebral edema was reported.

  abstract = {PURPOSE
The goal of this study is to identify and compare all direct costs of intravenous and subcutaneous rituximab given to patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in the Netherlands. 

METHODS
Using a prospective, observational, bottom-up microcosting study, we collected primary data on the direct medical costs of the preparation, administration, and acquisition of rituximab. Drug costs and costs of drug wastage, labor costs, material costs, and outpatient costs were identified using standardized forms, structured using prices from official pricelists, and compared for the intravenous and subcutaneous forms of rituximab. 

FINDINGS
Measurements were taken on 53 rituximab administrations (33 intravenous and 20 subcutaneous) and on 13 rituximab preparation (7 intravenous and 6 subcutaneous). The mean total costs were \texteuro{}2176.77 for the intravenous infusion and \texteuro{}1911.09 for the subcutaneous injection. The estimated difference of \texteuro{}265.17 (95\% CI, \texteuro{}231.99\textendash{}`\texteuro{}298.35) per administration was mainly attributable to differences in time spent in the chemotherapy unit, related outpatient costs, drug wastage, and drug costs. 

IMPLICATIONS
Rituximab administered in the form of subcutaneous injection is less costly than its intravenous form. With their equal effectiveness taken into account, subcutaneous rituximab administration can result in significant savings when transferred to the total diffuse large B-cell lymphoma population in the Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Background
Existing reports of utility values for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) vary quite widely and are not all suitable for use in submissions in the UK. The aim of this study was to elicit UK societal based utility values for different stages of NSCLC and different grade III-IV toxicities commonly associated with chemotherapy treatments. Toxicities included neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, rash and hair loss.

Methods
Existing health state descriptions of metastatic breast cancer were revised to make them suitable as descriptions of metastatic NSCLC patients on second-line treatment. The existing health states were used in cognitive debrief interviews with oncologists (n = 5) and oncology specialist nurses (n = 5). Changes were made as suggested by the clinical experts. The resulting health states (n = 17) were piloted and used in a societal based valuation study (n = 100). Participants rated half of the total health states in a standard gamble interview to derive health state utility scores. Data were analysed using a mixed model analysis.

Results
Each health state described the symptom burden of disease and impact on different levels of functioning (physical, emotional, sexual, and social). The disutility related to each disease state and toxicity was estimated and were combined to give health state values. All disease states and toxicities were independent significant predictors of utility (p {$<$} 0.001). Stable disease with no toxicity (our base state) had a utility value of 0.653. Utility scores ranged from 0.673 (responding disease with no toxicity) to 0.473 for progressive disease.

Conclusion
This study reflects the value that society place on the avoidance of disease progression and severe toxicities in NSCLC.},

  abstract = {Students of Markov decision models are often taught to add a half-cycle's worth of incremental utility to the cumulative total for each health state. The reason for this "half-cycle correction'' is often illustrated by a graph of the proportion of the hypothetical Markov cohort remaining in a given state. The ideal graph is shown as a smooth, declining, curve that represents the transition of patients randomly throughout each cycle. On the same graph, the effect of the accounting of state membership at the end of each cycle in discrete, computer-based approximations of the ideal Markov process is shown. Students are able to clearly see that the cumulative incremental utility in the discrete case underestimates the desired quantity. Likewise, they find the concept of shifting the ideal curve to the right by one-half cycle to reduce the latter discrepancy to be intuitive. However, students often find the approximate equivalence of shifting the ideal state membership curve and adding a half-cycle's worth of incremental utility to the total for the state at the beginning of a discrete Markov process to be a difficult cognitive leap. This article describes 2 pedagogical devices, algebraic and intuitive/visual approaches, that may assist the instructor of Markov theory to convey the latter concept. Elements of adult learning theory are discussed, which may help the instructor to choose which approach to employ. Implementation of the half-cycle correction in commonly used decision-analytic software is also discussed.},

Only articles published in English between 1990 and May 7, 2007, and including individuals of all ages with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus were included. Retrospective and prospective studies reporting adherence to medications using self-report, pill counts, medication possession ratios, and electronic monitoring devices were included. Database analyses of prescription records from various organizations or countries were included only if adherence to pharmaco-logic therapy was stated. Surveys and questionnaires assessing medication taking were also included. The data from the selected literature was abstracted independently. The various studies were grouped together based on the type of study conducted. Studies were not included if a specific measure of adherence to medication was not used or stated. The studies are presented in 3 tables according to design.},

The analyses were based on clinical trials CALGB 100104 and IFM 2005-02, from the perspective of the National Health System. The alternatives compared were the treatment with lenalidomide against maintenance without treatment (MwT). Efficiency measures used were years of life gained (YGs) and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). According to the CALGB 100104 trial data, the average health costs of patients who were treated with lenalidomide for 120 months was \texteuro{}836,534.31 and without treatment was \texteuro{}528,963.63. The effectiveness of the lenalidomide group was 7.59YGs (5.72 QALY) against 6.58 of MwT (4.61 QALY). The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) was \texteuro{}277,456.72/QALY and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was \texteuro{}303,191.05/YGs. From the analysis, the IFM2005-02 trial obtained 5.13 QALY in the lenalidomide group against the 4.98 QALY in the MwT group, with an ICUR of \texteuro{}1,502,780.55/QALY. In terms of budgetary impact, a range between 799 and 1452 patients susceptible to receive treatment with lenalidomide was assumed in Spain. In conclusion, the results show a high ICUR and budgetary impact, which adds uncertainty about the maximum prudent duration of the treatment.},

  abstract = {7563Background: There are multiple treatment regimens approved for the management of follicular lymphoma (FL). However, there is limited information available to describe the course of therapy (COT) that patients receive following FL diagnosis. Methods: Using the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry \& Medicare claims dataset, we analyzed patients 66 years and older diagnosed with FL from 2000 to 2011. In order to characterize FL treatments, we identified first, second and subsequent-lines of therapy listed in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines 2.2016. We identified the first COT (COT1) as the first regimen that a patient receives after diagnosis. We identified the second and third COT (COT2 and COT3) as new treatment received following/interrupting COT1 or COT2, respectively. Using visual analytics software, we investigated and reported the proportion of patients receiving each COT, the top three regimens within each COT, and the median time to starting a COT from diagnosis or end of a previous COT. Results: 10,836 FL patients were identified after applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Sixty-two percent (N=6,756) of the patients received FL-directed treatment. Among patients receiving COT1, 65\% received COT2. Among patients receiving COT2, 79\% received COT3. The table below provides additional information on the COT received. Conclusions: Analysis of real-world data indicates that almost 4 out of 10 elderly FL patients do not receive the listed FL-directed treatments. In contrast to rituximab, there was limited use of RCHOP and RCVP after COT1 during the study period. Additional research is needed to understand the differences across demographic groups and associated health outcomes.

  abstract = {Burkitt lymphoma is an aggressive B cell malignancy accounting for 1\textendash{}2\% of all adult lymphomas. Treatment with dose-intensive, multi-agent chemotherapy is effective but associated with considerable toxicity. In this observational study, we compared real-world efficacy, toxicity, and costs of four frequently employed treatment strategies for Burkitt lymphoma: the Lymphome Malins B (LMB), the Berlin-Frankfurt-M\"unster (BFM), the HOVON, and the CODOX-M/IVAC regimens. We collected data from 147 adult patients treated in eight referral centers. Following central pathology assessment, 105 of these cases were accepted as Burkitt lymphoma, resulting in the following treatment groups: LMB 36 patients, BFM 19 patients, HOVON 29 patients, and CODOX-M/IVAC 21 patients (median age 39~years, range 14\textendash{}74; mean duration of follow-up 47~months). There was no significant difference between age, sex ratio, disease stage, or percentage HIV-positive patients between the treatment groups. Five-year progression-free survival (69\%, p~=~0.966) and 5-year overall survival (69\%, p~=~0.981) were comparable for all treatment groups. Treatment-related toxicity was also comparable with only hepatotoxicity seen more frequently in the CODOX/M-IVAC group (p~=~0.004). Costs were determined by the number of rituximab gifts and the number of inpatients days. Overall, CODOX-M/IVAC had the most beneficial profile with regards to costs, treatment duration, and percentage of patients completing planned treatment. We conclude that the four treatment protocols for Burkitt lymphoma yield nearly identical results with regards to efficacy and safety but differ in treatment duration and costs. These differences may help guide future choice of treatment.},

  abstract = {Relapse is the main reason for treatment failure in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite improvements in the up-front therapy, survival after relapse is still relatively poor, especially for high-risk relapses. The aims of this study were to assess outcomes following acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapse after common initial Nordic Society of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology protocol treatment; to validate currently used risk stratifications, and identify additional prognostic factors for overall survival. Altogether, 516 of 2735 patients (18.9\%) relapsed between 1992 and 2011 and were included in the study. There were no statistically significant differences in outcome between the up-front protocols or between the relapse protocols used, but an improvement over time was observed. The 5-year overall survival for patients relapsing in the period 2002-2011 was 57.5{$\pm$}3.4\%, but 44.7{$\pm$}3.2\% (P{$<$}0.001) if relapse occurred in the period 1992-2001. Factors independently predicting mortality after relapse included short duration of first remission, bone marrow involvement, age ten years or over, unfavorable cytogenetics, and Down syndrome. T-cell immunophenotype was not an independent prognostic factor unless in combination with hyperleukocytosis at diagnosis. The outcome for early combined pre-B relapses was unexpectedly poor (5-year overall survival 38.0{$\pm$}10.6\%), which supports the notion that these patients need further risk adjustment. Although survival outcomes have improved over time, the development of novel approaches is urgently needed to increase survival in relapsed childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.},

However, there seem to be few model-selection criteria available in GEE. The well-known Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) cannot be directly applied since AIC is based on maximum likelihood estimation while GEE is nonlikelihood based. We propose a modification to AIC, where the likelihood is replaced by the quasi-likelihood and a proper adjustment is made for the penalty term. Its performance is investigated through simulation studies. For illustration, the method is applied to a real data set.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens.
METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease ({$\geq$}10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease ({$<$}10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312.
FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35{$\cdot$}9\% (95\% CI 25{$\cdot$}9-45{$\cdot$}9) in the idarubicin group versus 64{$\cdot$}6\% (54{$\cdot$}2-73{$\cdot$}2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0{$\cdot$}0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45{$\cdot$}2\% (34{$\cdot$}5-55{$\cdot$}3) versus 69{$\cdot$}0\% (58{$\cdot$}5-77{$\cdot$}3; p=0{$\cdot$}004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0{$\cdot$}56, 0{$\cdot$}34-0{$\cdot$}92, p=0{$\cdot$}007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0{$\cdot$}52, 0{$\cdot$}24-1{$\cdot$}11, p=0{$\cdot$}11).
INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

  abstract = {Pediatric Hematology Oncology as a specialty was possible because of the evolution of the science of Hematology, which developed microscopy for describing blood cell morphology and methods for quantitation of these elements. Before pediatric blood diseases could be defined, it was necessary to establish the normal blood values of infancy and childhood. The unique features of the blood of the newborn were the focus of many of the early studies. After normal values were established, specific blood disease and hematologic syndromes of children began to be described in Europe and the United States. Pediatric Hematology Oncology is a broad and complex area that encompasses perturbations of the several-formed elements of the blood and their precursors in the bone marrow, as well as the coagulation-fibrinolytic systems in the plasma, the reticuloendothelial system, and malignancies of the blood and solid tissues and organs. The interactions of the blood and nutrition have long been important areas of study. Advances in Pediatric Oncology have been particularly spectacular in the last 50 years. Using multi-modal therapy including combination chemotherapy, more than 80\% of children with cancer can now be cured. During the last 50 years, Pediatric Hematology Oncology has increasingly used tools of the ``new biology'': immunology, biochemistry, enzymology, genetics and molecular genetics, and others. During the last century, many diseases have been recognized and defined by biochemical and genetic mechanisms, and in some instances they have been prevented or cured.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine whether there was a relationship between disease activity and health functioning, as measured by a range of patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures in patients with follicular lymphoma (FL).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 222 patients with FL were recruited from eight sites across the UK and they completed a number of PRO measures. The participants were analyzed across five disease states: 'active disease-newly diagnosed', 'active disease-relapsed', 'partial response', 'complete response' and 'disease free'. The relationship between these disease states and their level of health functioning was assessed as well as the relationship between being 'on' or 'off' chemotherapy and disease state.
RESULTS: In terms of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), participants in the relapsed category had the lowest mean physical well-being, emotional well-being, functional well-being and social well-being score. In a regression analysis, the 'active disease-relapsed' group acted as a significant predictor for each PRO variable. In addition, the remission group acted as a significant predictor of high anxiety scores as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study demonstrate that various aspects of patient-reported health outcomes differ according to disease state in patients with FL. For those patients who have relapsed, they are more likely to experience worse HRQoL and other patient-reported health outcomes than patients newly diagnosed, in partial or complete remission or when completely disease free.},

Pediatric trials may be particularly vulnerable to these outcomes given the challenges encountered in conducting trials in children. We aimed to determine the prevalence of discontinuation and nonpublication of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) conducted in pediatric populations.
METHODS: Retrospective, cross-sectional study of pediatric RCTs registered in ClinicalTrials.gov from 2008 to 2010. Data were collected from the registry and associated publications identified (final search on September 1, 2015).
RESULTS: Of 559 trials, 104 (19\%) were discontinued early, accounting for an estimated 8369 pediatric participants. Difficulty with patient accrual (37\%) was the most commonly cited reason for discontinuation. Trials were less likely to be discontinued if they were funded by industry compared with academic institutions (odds ratio [OR] 0.46, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.27\textendash{}0.77). Of the 455 completed trials, 136 (30\%) were not published, representing 69 165 pediatric participants. Forty-two unpublished trials posted results on ClinicalTrials.gov. Trials funded by industry were more than twice as likely to result in nonpublication at 24 and 36 months (OR 2.21, 95\% CI 1.35\textendash{}3.64; OR 3.12, 95\% CI 1.6\textendash{}6.08, respectively) and had a longer mean time to publication compared with trials sponsored by academia (33 vs 24 months, P {$<$} .001).
CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of pediatric RCTs, discontinuation and nonpublication were common, with thousands of children exposed to interventions that did not lead to informative or published findings. Trial funding source was an important determinant of these outcomes, with both academic and industry sponsors contributing to inefficiencies.},

Countries make different decisions regarding which cancer treatments to routinely provide. As a result, depending on the cancer drug-indication and the country assessing it, the decision can be Favourable, Favourable with restrictions or Non-Favourable. The main objective of this paper is to describe the differences in drug reimbursement decisions on cancer drugs across 10 European countries. This aim is achieved through testing a number of hypotheses that can explain the differences in these specific reimbursement decisions. First of all, we collect data on cancer drug decisions for 10 European countries, from 2002 to 2014. Secondly, the hypotheses are tested on this database. The results show that Social Health Insurance systems tend to take more Favourable decisions than the tax-based systems, that cost-effective drug-indications have a higher probability of reimbursement and that other countries are more likely to make a Favourable decision if NICE also make it. Moreover, our findings also corroborate that an economic evaluation requirement reduces the number of Favourable decisions, and that, during the global financial crisis, the number of Favourable decisions has been reduced, compared to Non-Favourable and restricted. To sum up, characteristics of the drug reimbursement system, drug particularities and the socioeconomic situation are the main factors determining the differences across countries.},

Nowadays, the Group comprises researchers from Canada, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Japan, New Zealand, Slovenia, Spain, the USA and Zimbabwe. The process of shared development and local experimentation resulted in EQ-5D, a generic measure of health status that provides a simple descriptive profile and a single index value that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care and in population health surveys. Currently, EQ-5D is being widely used in different countries by clinical researchers in a variety of clinical areas. EQ-5D is also being used by eight out of the first 10 of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies listed in the annual report of Pharma Business (November/December 1999). Furthermore, EQ-5D is one of the handful of measures recommended for use in cost-effectiveness analyses by the Washington Panel on Cost Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. EQ-5D has now been translated into most major languages with the EuroQol Group closely monitoring the process.},

  abstract = {The EuroQol five-dimensional (EQ-5D) questionnaire is used worldwide as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument for the measurement and valuation of health. Several variants of the instrument now exist, including versions with three and five levels of severity and one for respondents aged 8 to 14 years. From the outset, a demand for new language versions of the EQ-5D questionnaire meant that there was a need to implement standardized procedures, which ensured that such versions were produced following international recommendations for the cultural adaptation of patient-reported outcomes. The availability of new variants and formats of the instrument, such as telephone-administered or electronic formats, complicated the task of providing and controlling the quality of cultural adaptations. Although cultural adaptations of the instrument are widely used, the procedures currently used to produce them have not been widely disseminated. The present article therefore describes the evolution of the production of other language versions of the instrument from the earliest days of simultaneous production and translation of the EQ-5D questionnaire to the more recent, broader-based strategy of version management. We describe current adaptation procedures and innovations within those procedures. We also describe how version management is organized within the EuroQol Group, review aspects related to quality control, and provide an overview of the number of currently available language versions for each variant of the EQ-5D questionnaire: three-level, five-level, and youth versions. We conclude by discussing some of the relevant issues related to cultural adaptation for frequently used instruments such as the EQ-5D questionnaire.},

Total costs of treatment were determined from variables in administrative databases in a universally accessible and publicly funded healthcare system. Valid HRQL assessments (n\,=\,1200) were collected for 307 BFM and 317 DFCI patients, with costs measured for 66 BFM and 28 DFCI patients. QALYs per patient were {$<$}1.0\% greater for BFM than DFCI. Median HRQL scores revealed no difference in QALYs. The difference in mean total costs for BFM (US\$88\,480) and DFCI (US\$93\,026) was not significant (P\,=\,0.600). This study provides no evidence of superiority for one treatment strategy over the other. Current BFM or DFCI strategies should represent conventional management for the next economic evaluation of treatments for ALL in childhood.},

The Evidence Review Group (ERG), the School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield, produced a document summarising the key points from the company submission alongside a critical review. Efficacy for progression-free survival (PFS) and safety was positively demonstrated in the pivotal GADOLIN trial, which compared obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance (O-Benda+O) against bendamustine monotherapy. Data on overall survival were immature. The company submitted a model-based economic analysis, including a patient access scheme. The ERG identified a number of limitations, in particular the absence of subgroup analysis and the approach used by the company to estimate overall survival (OS), which was more favourable to the intervention arm. The key uncertainty was the duration of the treatment effect on OS. This uncertainty is expected to be reduced when the final analysis of the GADOLIN trial is reported. Consequently, the NICE appraisal committee recommended O-Benda+O in the population covered by the marketing authorisation within the Cancer Drug Fund until NICE is able to review the guidance following publication of the final analysis of GADOLIN.},

At diagnosis, the presence of Bcl-2/IgH-positive cells in the peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) was demonstrated in all patients (n = 128) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. Patients who achieved a clinical response following CHOP but remained PCR-positive were eligible for rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously, weekly for 4 weeks). After CHOP, 57\% achieved a complete response (CR), 37\% a partial response (PR), and 6\% were nonresponders (NR). At this stage, patients proving PCR-negative (n = 41) or failing to achieve a clinical response (n = 8) were excluded from rituximab treatment. Seventy-seven patients received rituximab and entered a scheduled MRD follow-up program. At the first molecular follow-up (+12 weeks), 59\% had converted to PCR negativity in the BM and PB, with a further increase documented at the second control (+28 weeks) with 74\% PCR negative. At the last molecular follow-up (+44 weeks), 63\% of the patients remained PCR negative. At 3 years, the estimated overall survival of all patients is 95\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 86-98). For patients achieving PCR-negative status following CHOP and therefore excluded from rituximab treatment, freedom from recurrence (FFR) was 52\% (95\% CI, 28-71). For patients treated with rituximab, a durable PCR-negative status was associated with a better clinical outcome since FFR was 57\% (95\% CI, 23-81) compared with 20\% (95\% CI, 4-46) in patients who never achieved or lost the molecular negativity (P {$<$}.001).},

  abstract = {Which costs and benefits to consider in economic evaluations of healthcare interventions remains an area of much controversy. Unrelated medical costs in life-years gained is an important cost category that is normally ignored in economic evaluations, irrespective of the perspective chosen for the analysis. National guidelines for pharmacoeconomic research largely endorse this practice, either by explicitly requiring researchers to exclude these costs from the analysis or by leaving inclusion or exclusion up to the discretion of the analyst. However, the inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life-years gained appears to be gaining support in the literature.This article provides an overview of the discussions to date. The inclusion of unrelated medical costs in life-years gained seems warranted, in terms of both optimality and internal and external consistency. We use an example of a smoking-cessation intervention to highlight the consequences of different practices of accounting for costs and effects in economic evaluations. Only inclusion of all costs and effects of unrelated medical care in life-years gained can be considered both internally and externally consistent. Including or excluding unrelated future medical costs may have important distributional consequences, especially for interventions that substantially increase length of life. Regarding practical objections against inclusion of future costs, it is important to note that it is becoming increasingly possible to accurately estimate unrelated medical costs in life-years gained. We therefore conclude that the inclusion of unrelated medical costs should become the new standard.},

  abstract = {Purpose:
Stagnant outcomes for adolescents and young adults (AYAs; 15 to 39 years old) with cancer are partly attributed to poor enrollment onto clinical trials. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOP) was developed to improve clinical trial participation in the community setting, where AYAs are most often treated. Further, many CCOP sites had pediatric and medical oncologists with collaborative potential for AYA recruitment and care. For these reasons, we hypothesized that CCOP sites enrolled proportionately more AYAs than non-CCOP sites onto Children's Oncology Group (COG) trials.

Methods:
For the 10-year period 2004 through 2013, the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention database was queried to evaluate enrollments into relevant COG studies. The proportional enrollment of AYAs at CCOP and non-CCOP sites was compared and the change in AYA enrollment patterns assessed. All sites were COG member institutions.

Results:
Although CCOP sites enrolled a higher proportion of patients in cancer control studies than non-CCOP sites (3.5\% v 1.8\%; P {$<$} .001), they enrolled a lower proportion of AYAs (24.1\% v 28.2\%, respectively; P {$<$} .001). Proportional AYA enrollment at CCOP sites decreased during the intervals 2004 through 2008 and 2009 through 2013 (26.7\% v 21.7\%; P {$<$} .001).

Conclusion:
Despite oncology practice settings that might be expected to achieve otherwise, CCOP sites did not enroll a larger proportion of AYAs in clinical trials than traditional COG institutions. Our findings suggest that the CCOP (now the NCI Community Oncology Research Program) can be leveraged for developing targeted interventions for overcoming AYA enrollment barriers.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel) was recently approved for treatment of relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) following two or more prior therapies. As the first CAR T-cell therapy available for adults in the US, there are important questions about clinical and economic value. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of axi-cel compared to salvage chemotherapy using a decision model and a US payer perspective. Materials and methods: A decision model was developed to estimate life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and lifetime cost for adult patients with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel vs salvage chemotherapy (R-DHAP). Patient-level analyses of the ZUMA-1 and SCHOLAR-1 studies were used to inform the model and to estimate the proportion achieving long-term survival. Drug and procedure costs were derived from US average sales prices and Medicare reimbursement schedules. Future healthcare costs in long-term remission was derived from per capita Medicare spending. Utility values were derived from patient-level data from ZUMA-1 and external literature. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses evaluated uncertainty. Outcomes were calculated over a lifetime horizon and were discounted at 3\% per year. Results: In the base case, LYs, QALYs, and lifetime costs were 9.5, 7.7, and \$552,921 for axi-cel vs 2.6, 1.1, and \$172,737 for salvage chemotherapy, respectively. The axi-cel cost per QALY gained was \$58,146. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the fraction achieving long-term remission, discount rate, and axi-cel price. The likelihood that axi-cel is cost-effective was 95\% at a willingness to pay of \$100,000 per QALY. Conclusion: Axi-cel is a potentially cost-effective alternative to salvage chemotherapy for adults with R/R LBCL. Long-term follow-up is necessary to reduce uncertainties about health outcomes.},

  abstract = {Modelling of censored survival data is almost always done by Cox proportional-hazards regression. However, use of parametric models for such data may have some advantages. For example, non-proportional hazards, a potential difficulty with Cox models, may sometimes be handled in a simple way, and visualization of the hazard function is much easier. Extensions of the Weibull and log-logistic models are proposed in which natural cubic splines are used to smooth the baseline log cumulative hazard and log cumulative odds of failure functions. Further extensions to allow non-proportional effects of some or all of the covariates are introduced. A hypothesis test of the appropriateness of the scale chosen for covariate effects (such as of treatment) is proposed. The new models are applied to two data sets in cancer. The results throw interesting light on the behaviour of both the hazard function and the hazard ratio over time. The tools described here may be a step towards providing greater insight into the natural history of the disease and into possible underlying causes of clinical events. We illustrate these aspects by using the two examples in cancer.},

  abstract = {This article reviews approaches to pharmaceutical pricing in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain to inform better understanding of the role of external reference pricing and its relevance to the UK., External reference pricing, or international price comparison, is a common strategy to control prices of pharmaceuticals that are protected by intellectual property rights and benefit from a legal monopoly (in-patent drugs). In the UK negotiations are under way that seek to define new arrangements for the pricing of branded (new) medicines from 2014. The pharmaceutical market in the UK only accounts for a small proportion of global sales; however, UK prices are important as many countries reference their prices against those in the UK. This article seeks to contribute to our understanding of approaches to pharmaceutical pricing in high-income countries and the role of reference pricing as a means to determining pharmaceutical prices. Reviewing experiences in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, we find high variability of external reference pricing across different settings and of the relative importance of this approach in comparison with other pricing strategies. There was also considerable variation in the terminology and practices used, and understanding the complexities of countries included in reference baskets for external pricing requires considerable semantic clarification. There was considerable overlap between countries that cross-reference, and it remains challenging to estimate the direct, immediate impact on external reference baskets. This review suggests that the international impact of pricing changes in the UK is likely to be minimal or indirect, largely because of the diverse ways in which reference pricing is implemented in the countries examined.},

  abstract = {Background: Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy is a new class of cancer therapy with promising results, but comes at a high upfront cost. We sought to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CAR-T therapy among pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Methods: We built a microsimulation model for pediatric patients with r/r ALL who received either CAR-T therapy or standard of care chemotherapy. Outcomes modeled included costs, quality of life (health utility), treatment complications, and survival, all of which were estimated from published literature. Long-term survival beyond the timeframe of clinical trial data was estimated using Social Security actuarial life-tables adjusted with standardized mortality ratios. Cost-effectiveness was measured with the incremental costeffectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under \$100,000 per qualityadjusted life year (QALY) considered cost-effective. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to assess overall stability of the model. Results: Compared to standard of care chemotherapy CAR-T increased the total cost of treatment by \$378,600 and increased effectiveness by 6.72 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of \$56,300 per QALY. The model was sensitive to assumptions about long-term CAR-T survival, the cost of CAR-T, and duration of IVIG required in CAR-T responders. The base model assumed a 79\% one-year survival with CAR-T therapy, though if the one-year survival decreased to 61\% then the ICER of CAR-T increased above \$100,000 per QALY. If the cost of CAR-T infusion increased from \$475,000 to \$781,000, or if the duration of IVIG infusions extend beyond 12 years then the ICER of CAR-T therapy increased above \$100,000 per QALY. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis CAR-T was cost-effective in {$>$} 99\% of iterations at a willingness to pay of \$100,000 per QALY. Conclusions: Despite its high cost, CAR-T therapy has an acceptable cost-effectiveness profile for pediatric r/r ALL. Additional follow-up of this cohort is required to establish long-term outcomes and further inform questions about the costeffectiveness of CAR-T therapy.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE Although the life expectancy of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) has increased, little is known of their causes of death (CODs) in the rituximab era. PATIENTS AND METHODS We pooled two cohorts of newly diagnosed patients with FL grade 1-3A. Patients were enrolled between 2001 and 2013 in two French referral institutions (N = 734; median follow-up 89 months) and 2002 and 2012 in the University of Iowa and Mayo Clinic Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE; N = 920; median follow-up 84 months). COD was classified as being a result of lymphoma, other malignancy, treatment related, or all other causes. RESULTS Ten-year overall survival was comparable in the French (80\%) and US (77\%) cohorts. We were able to classify COD in 248 (88\%) of 283 decedents. In the overall cohort, lymphoma was the most common COD, with a cumulative incidence of 10.3\% at 10 years, followed by treatment-related mortality (3.0\%), other malignancy (2.9\%), other causes (2.2\%), and unknown (3.0\%). The 10-year cumulative incidence of death as a result of lymphoma or treatment was higher than death as a result of all other causes for each age group (including patients {$\geq$} 70 years of age at diagnosis [25.4\% v 16.6\%]) Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 3 to 5 (27.4\% v 5.2\%), but not Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score 0 to 1 (4.0\% v 3.7\%); for patients who failed to achieve event-free survival within 24 months from diagnosis (36.1\% v 7.0\%), but not for patients who achieved event-free survival within 24 months of diagnosis (6.7\% v 5.7\%); and for patients with a history of transformed FL (45.9\% v 4.7\%), but not among patients without (8.1\% v 6.2\%). Overall, 77 of 140 deaths as a result of lymphoma occurred in patients whose FL transformed after diagnosis. CONCLUSION Despite the improvement in overall survival in patients with FL in the rituximab era, their leading COD remains lymphoma, especially after disease transformation. Treatment-related mortality also represents a concern, which supports the need for less-toxic therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma who fail to achieve adequate disease control with rituximab-based treatment have few treatment options and a poor prognosis. We aimed to assess a combination of obinutuzumab (GA101), a novel glyco-engineered type II anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and bendamustine in this patient population.
METHODS: In this open-label, randomised, phase 3 study (GADOLIN), patients aged 18 years or older with histologically documented, CD20-positive indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma refractory to rituximab were enrolled at 83 hospital and community sites in 14 countries in Europe, Asia, and North and Central America. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) using a hierarchical dynamic randomisation scheme stratified by indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype, rituximab-refractory type, number of previous therapies, and geographical region, to receive induction treatment (six 28-day cycles) with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine or bendamustine monotherapy, both given intravenously. Obinutuzumab plus bendamustine dosing was obinutuzumab 1000 mg (days 1, 8, and 15, cycle 1; day 1, cycles 2-6) plus bendamustine 90 mg/m(2) per day (days 1 and 2, cycles 1-6), and bendamustine monotherapy dosing was 120 mg/m(2) per day (days 1 and 2, all cycles). Non-progressing patients in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group received obinutuzumab maintenance (1000 mg every 2 months) for up to 2 years. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in all randomised patients, as assessed by an independent review committee. Safety was assessed in all patients who received any amount of obinutuzumab or bendamustine. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01059630, and has stopped recruiting patients.
FINDINGS: Between April 15, 2010, and Sept 1, 2014, when the study was stopped after a pre-planned interim analysis, 396 patients were randomly assigned (194 to obinutuzumab plus bendamustine and 202 to bendamustine monotherapy). After a median follow-up time of 21{$\cdot$}9 months (IQR 12{$\cdot$}1-31{$\cdot$}0) in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and 20{$\cdot$}3 months (9{$\cdot$}5-29{$\cdot$}7) in the bendamustine monotherapy group, progression-free survival was significantly longer with obinutuzumab plus bendamustine (median not reached [95\% CI 22{$\cdot$}5 months-not estimable]) than with bendamustine monotherapy (14{$\cdot$}9 months [12{$\cdot$}8-16{$\cdot$}6]; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}55 [95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}40-0{$\cdot$}74]; p=0{$\cdot$}0001). Grade 3-5 adverse events occurred in 132 (68\%) of 194 patients in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and in 123 (62\%) of 198 patients in the bendamustine monotherapy group. The most frequent grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (64 [33\%] in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group vs 52 [26\%] in the bendamustine monotherapy group), thrombocytopenia (21 [11\%] vs 32 [16\%]), anaemia (15 [8\%] vs 20 [10\%]) and infusion-related reactions (21 [11\%] vs 11 [6\%]). Serious adverse events occurred in 74 patients (38\%) in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and in 65 patients (33\%) in the bendamustine monotherapy group, and deaths due to adverse events occurred in 12 patients (6\%) and 12 patients (6\%), respectively. Three (25\%) of 12 adverse event-related deaths in the obinutuzumab plus bendamustine group and five (42\%) of 12 in the bendamustine monotherapy group were treatment related.
INTERPRETATION: Obinutuzumab plus bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance has improved efficacy over bendamustine monotherapy in rituximab-refractory patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma, with manageable toxicity, and is a new treatment option for patients who have relapsed after or are no longer responding to rituximab-based therapy.

  abstract = {Purpose: R-CHOP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisone) and R-CVP (rituximab with cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone) have both been used successfully in the treatment of patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma (FL). No study has compared the efficacy of the two treatment modalities and attempted to evaluate the role of anthracyclines in the management of patients with FL. We conducted a meta-analysis of relevant literature comparing the two treatment arms for FL with response being the final endpoint. Patients and Methods: Two analyses were conducted: The first analysis compared R-CHOP to R-CVP as frontline agents for the treatment of FL, and the second analysis included both untreated and relapsed patients.
Results: For both studies, R-CVP was superior to R-CHOP when evaluating for complete response (CR). Odds ratios were 2.86 (95\% CI, 1.81\textendash{}4.51) in the first analysis and 1.48 (95\% CI, 0.991\textendash{}2.22) in the second analysis. However for overall response (CR+Partial response, PR), RCHOP was superior, with odds ratios of 5.45 (95\% CI: 2.51 \textendash{} 11.83) and 5.54 (95\% CI: 2.69 \textendash{}11.40), for the first and second analyses, respectively.
Conclusion: R-CHOP and R-CVP protocols achieve excellent overall response. In patients with known cardiac history, omission of anthracyclines is reasonable and R-CVP provides a competitive CR rate. In younger patients with FL where cumulative cardio-toxicity may be of importance in the long term and in whom future stem cell transplantation is an option, again R-CVP may be a more appealing option.},

However, the disease remains quite heterogeneous and a substantial number of patients have more aggressive disease with short responses to therapy and/or transformation to higher-grade lymphomas. Given the lack of a single standard approach, it is important to understand sources of heterogeneity among patients that influence initial management, surveillance strategies, and overall prognosis. Most of the validated tools, such as the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) and FLIPI-2, apply to the frontline setting, and there is an unmet need for prognostic tools in relapsed and refractory disease states. In particular, the number of prior treatment regimens may be less important than the duration of response to the most recent regimen and the type of prior therapy received. Furthermore, despite awareness of progressive genetic and epigenetic derangements and a growing appreciation of the microenvironment's role in FL outcomes, there is no validated means of incorporating biologic data into clinical prognostic indices. This review highlights the current state of knowledge regarding risk stratification in FL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND METHODS: It is uncertain whether mortality rates among patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation return to the level of the mortality rates of the general population. We analyzed the characteristics of 6691 patients listed in the International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry. All the patients were free of their original disease two years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Mortality rates in this cohort were compared with those of an age-, sex-, and nationality-matched general population. Cox proportional-hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for death more than two years after transplantation (late death).
RESULTS: Among patients who were free of disease two years after transplantation, the probability of living for five more years was 89 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 88 to 90 percent). Among patients who underwent transplantation for aplastic anemia, the risk of death by the sixth year after transplantation did not differ significantly from that of a normal population. Mortality remained significantly higher than normal throughout the study among patients who underwent transplantation for acute lymphoblastic leukemia or chronic myelogenous leukemia and through the ninth year among those who underwent transplantation for acute myelogenous leukemia. Recurrent leukemia was the chief cause of death among patients who received a transplant for leukemia, whereas chronic graft-versus-host disease was the chief cause among those who received a transplant for aplastic anemia. Advanced, long-standing disease before transplantation and active chronic graft-versus-host disease were important risk factors for late death.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who receive an allogeneic bone marrow transplant as treatment for acute myelogenous or lymphoblastic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or aplastic anemia and who are free of their original disease two years later, the disease is probably cured. However, for many years after transplantation, the mortality among these patients is higher than that in a normal population.},

  abstract = {Purpose Blinatumomab is a bispecific T-cell engager antibody construct targeting CD19 on B-cell lymphoblasts. We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics, recommended dosage, and potential for efficacy of blinatumomab in children with relapsed/refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Methods This open-label study enrolled children {$<$} 18 years old with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL in a phase I dosage-escalation part and a phase II part, using 6-week treatment cycles. Primary end points were maximum-tolerated dosage (phase I) and complete remission rate within the first two cycles (phase II). Results We treated 49 patients in phase I and 44 patients in phase II. Four patients had dose-limiting toxicities in cycle 1 (phase I). Three experienced grade 4 cytokine-release syndrome (one attributed to grade 5 cardiac failure); one had fatal respiratory failure. The maximum-tolerated dosage was 15 \textmu{}g/m2/d. Blinatumomab pharmacokinetics was linear across dosage levels and consistent among age groups. On the basis of the phase I data, the recommended blinatumomab dosage for children with relapsed/refractory ALL was 5 \textmu{}g/m2/d for the first 7 days, followed by 15 \textmu{}g/m2/d thereafter. Among the 70 patients who received the recommended dosage, 27 (39\%; 95\% CI, 27\% to 51\%) achieved complete remission within the first two cycles, 14 (52\%) of whom achieved complete minimal residual disease response. The most frequent grade {$\geq$} 3 adverse events were anemia (36\%), thrombocytopenia (21\%), and hypokalemia (17\%). Three patients (4\%) and one patient (1\%) had cytokine-release syndrome of grade 3 and 4, respectively. Two patients (3\%) interrupted treatment after grade 2 seizures. Conclusion This trial, which to the best of our knowledge was the first such trial in pediatrics, demonstrated antileukemic activity of single-agent blinatumomab with complete minimal residual disease response in children with relapsed/refractory BCP-ALL. Blinatumomab may represent an important new treatment option in this setting, requiring further investigation in curative indications.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Examining covariate balance is the prescribed method for determining the degree to which propensity score methods should be successful at reducing bias. This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (similar to a disease risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate.
STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only.
RESULTS: The absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD) in prognostic scores, the mean ASMD (in covariates), and the mean t-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations with bias of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification, and the prognostic score measure performed well under a variety of scenarios.
CONCLUSION: Researchers should consider using prognostic score-based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in nonexperimental studies.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Economic evaluations conducted in children have unique features compared to adults. Important developments in pediatric economic evaluation in recent years include new options for valuing health states for cost-utility analysis (CUA) and shifting child health priorities. The Pediatric Economic Database Evaluation (PEDE) project includes a comprehensive database of pediatric health economic evaluations published since 1980. The objective of this scoping review was to identify trends over time in the use of CUA and other analytic techniques, and the therapeutic areas chosen for study. Areas covered: Medical and grey literature were searched, key characteristics were extracted, frequencies were tabulated and cross-tabulations were performed. Differences between early (1980 and 1999) and late (2000 and 2014) periods were assessed using a chi-squared statistic. Of the 2,776 pediatric economic evaluations published between 1980 and 2014, substantially more were cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) and CUAs than cost benefit analyses and cost minimization analyses (63.9 and 24.9\% versus 7.6 and 3.6\%, respectively). This pattern was consistent regardless of the type of intervention, disease or age group studied. A trend toward higher proportions of CUAs and CEAs was evident in the later period (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001). Other significant trends included a higher proportion of studies of preventive interventions (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001), and more studies in children aged 1 to 12~years and fewer in perinates in the later period (X2 p~{$<~$}0.0001). Overall the most common disease class studied was infectious diseases (29.2\%). Expert commentary: Pediatric economic evaluation continues to grow in volume and methodologic complexity. While CUAs have increased, whether their quality has improved remains unknown. Although most studies are in infectious disease, the volume of publications may not align with emerging child health priorities such as adolescent health, injury, developmental disabilities, mental health, and the use of personalized medicine. Increasing economic evaluations in these areas will enhance pediatric decision-making.},

  abstract = {Objective:The aim of the study was to obtain United Kingdom societal preferences for receiving newly developed treatments for metastatic renal cell carcinoma.Methods:Health states were developed based on a literature review and in-depth interviews with clinical experts. These states described the burden of both stable and progressive disease, and a variety of commonly encountered toxicities associated with first-line therapies (fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea/vomiting, mucositis, hand/foot syndrome, hypertension and anaemia). These states were further reviewed by additional clinicians and patients to ensure their validity. One hundred members of the general public rated the states using the time trade-off (TTO) methodology to determine health state utility.Results:Stable disease had a utility value of 0.795 whilst progressive disease demonstrated a significant decline with a value of 0.355. The range of toxicities showed a variable impact in line with their toxicity grading from fatigue grade I/II (0.751) to hand/foot syndrome grade III (0.469).Conclusions:This study highlights the burden associated with a number of common toxicities encountered with current first-line mRCC treatments. Practical constraints coupled with the societal nature of the valuation exercise limited the amount of direct involvement by patients. However, these utility values should better permit the consideration of toxicity profiles in establishing the cost-effectiveness of future treatments.},

  abstract = {Recent studies report an improvement in overall survival (OS) of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL). Previously untreated patients with grade 1 to 2 FL treated at Stanford University from 1960-2003 were identified. Four eras were considered: era 1, pre-anthracycline (1960-1975, n = 180); era 2, anthracycline (1976-1986, n = 426); era 3, aggressive chemotherapy/purine analogs (1987-1996, n = 471); and era 4, rituximab (1997-2003, n = 257). Clinical characteristics, patterns of care, and survival were assessed. Observed OS was compared with the expected OS calculated from Berkeley Mortality Database life tables derived from population matched by gender and age at the time of diagnosis. The median OS was 13.6 years. Age, gender, and stage did not differ across the eras. Although primary treatment varied, event-free survival after the first treatment did not differ between eras (P = .17). Median OS improved from 11 years in eras 1 and 2 to 18.4 years in era 3 and has not yet been reached for era 4 (P {$<$} .001), with no suggestion of a plateau in any era. These improvements in OS exceeded improvements in survival in the general population during the same period. Several factors, including better supportive care and effective therapies for relapsed disease, are likely responsible for this improvement.},

  abstract = {Child maltreatment is prognostically associated with long-term detrimental consequences for mental health. These consequences are reflected in higher costs due to health service utilization and productivity losses in adulthood. An above-average sense of mastery can have protective effects in the pathogenesis of mental disorders and thus potentially cushion adverse impacts of maltreatment. This should be reflected in lower costs in individuals with a history of child maltreatment and a high sense of mastery. The aims of the study were to prognostically estimate the excess costs of health service uptake and productivity losses in adults with a history of child maltreatment and to evaluate how mastery may act as an effect modifier. Data were used on 5618 individuals participating in the Netherlands Mental Health Survey and Incidence Study (NEMESIS). We focussed on measures of child maltreatment (emotional neglect, physical, psychological and sexual abuse) and economic costs owing to health-care uptake and productivity losses when people with a history of abuse have grown into adulthood. We evaluated how mastery acted as an effect modifier. Estimates were adjusted for demographics and parental psychopathology. Post-stratification weights were used to account for initial non-response and dropout. Due to the non-normal distribution of the costs data, sample errors, 95~\% confidence intervals, and p values were calculated using non-parametric bootstrapping (1000 replications). Exposure to child maltreatment occurs frequently (6.9\textendash{}24.8~\%) and is associated with substantial excess costs in adulthood. To illustrate, adjusted annual excess costs attributable to emotional neglect are \texteuro{}1,360 (95~\% CI: 615\textendash{}215) per adult. Mastery showed a significant effect on these figures: annual costs were \texteuro{}1,608 in those with a low sense of mastery, but only \texteuro{}474 in those with a firmer sense of mastery. Child maltreatment has profound mental health consequences and is associated with staggering long-term economic costs, rendering lack of action very costly. Our data lends credibility to the hypothesis that mastery may help to cushion the adverse consequences of child maltreatment. Further research on mastery may help to ameliorate individual burden and in addition offer some economic benefits.},

  abstract = {The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), as part of the institute's single technology appraisal (STA) process, invited the company that makes obinutuzumab (Roche Products Limited) to submit evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of the drug in combination with chemotherapy, with or without obinutuzumab as maintenance therapy for adult patients with untreated, advanced follicular lymphoma (FL) in the UK. Kleijnen Systematic Reviews Ltd (KSR), in collaboration with Erasmus University Rotterdam, was commissioned to act as the Evidence Review Group (ERG). This paper describes the company's submission, the ERG review, and NICE's subsequent decisions. The clinical evidence was derived from two phase III, company-sponsored, randomised, open-label studies. Most evidence on obinutuzumab was based on the GALLIUM trial that compared obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by obinutuzumab maintenance monotherapy with rituximab in combination with chemotherapy as induction followed by rituximab maintenance monotherapy in previously untreated patients with FL (grades 1\textendash{}3a). Long-term clinical evidence was based on the PRIMA trial, studying the benefit of two years of rituximab maintenance after first-line treatment in patients with FL. The cost-effectiveness evidence submitted by the company relied on a partitioned survival cost-utility model, implemented in Microsoft\textregistered{} Excel. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) presented in the company submission was {$<\pounds$}20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Although the ERG concluded that the economic model met the NICE reference case to a reasonable extent, some errors were identified and several assumptions made by the company were challenged. A new base-case scenario produced by the ERG suggested an ICER that was higher than the company base case, but still below \textsterling{}30,000 per QALY gained. However, some ERG scenario analyses were close to or even above the threshold. This was the case in particular for assuming a treatment effect that did not extend beyond trial follow-up. These results led to an initial negative recommendation by the appraisal committee. Subsequently, the company submitted a revised base case focusing on patients at intermediate or high risk of premature mortality. Simultaneously, a further price discount for obinutuzumab was granted. In addition to the company's revised base case, the ERG suggested a restriction of the treatment effect to 5 years and implemented biosimilar uptake and cheaper prices for rituximab. All of these adjustments did not exceed \textsterling{}30,000 per QALY gained and therefore the use of obinutuzumab for patients with advanced FL and a Follicular Lymphoma International Predictive Index (FLIPI) score of two or more could be recommended.},

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel (list price: 320 000 EUR) among these patients when compared to clofarabine monotherapy (Clo-M), clofarabine combination therapy (Clo-C), and blinatumomab (Blina) from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. We also assessed future medical and future non-medical consumption costs. Methods A three-state partitioned survival model was used to simulate a cohort of pediatric patients (12 years of age) through different disease states until the end of life (lifetime horizon). Relevant outcomes were life years, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), healthcare costs, societal costs, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Uncertainty was explored through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses as well as through several scenario analyzes. Results Total discounted costs for tisagenlecleucel were 552 679 EUR from a societal perspective, which was much higher than the total discounted costs from a healthcare perspective (ie, 409 563 EUR). Total discounted societal costs for the comparator regimens ranged between 160 803 EUR for Clo-M and 267 259 EUR for Blina. Highest QALYs were estimated for tisagenlecleucel (11.26), followed by Blina (2.25), Clo-C (1.70) and Clo-M (0.74). Discounted societal ICERs of tisagenlecleucel ranged between 31 682 EUR/QALY for Blina and 37 531 EUR/QALY for Clo-C and were considered cost-effective with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of 80 000 EUR/QALY. None of the scenarios exceeded this threshold, and more than 98\% of the iterations in the probabilistic sensitivity analysis were cost-effective. Discussion At the current price and WTP threshold, tisagenlecleucel is cost-effective from both a healthcare and a societal perspective. Nevertheless, long-term effectiveness data are needed to validate the several assumptions that were necessary for this model.},

We position these agreements as a form of coverage with evidence development. New performance-based risk sharing could produce a more efficient market equilibrium, achieved by adjustment of the price post-launch to reflect outcomes combined with a new approach to the post-launch costs of evidence collection. For this to happen, the party best able to manage or to bear specific risks must do so. Willingness to bear risk will depend not only on ability to manage it, but on the degree of risk aversion. We identify three related frameworks that provide relevant insights: value of information, real option theory and money-back guarantees. We identify four categories of risk sharing: budget impact, price discounting, outcomes uncertainty and subgroup uncertainty.},

Information on the efficacy and safety of Rd and VMP was based on data from multinational phase III clinical trials and a network meta-analysis. Pre-progression direct costs included the costs of Rd and VMP, treatment of adverse events (including prophylaxis) and routine care and monitoring associated with MM. Post-progression direct costs included costs of subsequent treatment(s) and routine care and monitoring for progressive disease, all obtained from published literature and estimated from a US payer perspective. Utilities were obtained from the aforementioned trials. Costs and outcomes were discounted at 3\% annually.Results:Relative to VMP, use of Rd was expected to result in an additional 2.22 LYs and 1.47 QALYs (discounted). Patients initiated with Rd were expected to incur an additional \$78,977 in mean lifetime direct costs (discounted) vs those initiated with VMP. The incremental costs per QALY and per LY gained with Rd vs VMP were \$53,826 and \$35,552, respectively. In sensitivity analyses, results were found to be most sensitive to differences in survival associated with Rd vs VMP, the cost of lenalidomide and the discount rate applied to effectiveness outcomes.Conclusions:Rd was expected to result in greater LYs and QALYs compared with VMP, with similar overall costs per LY for each regimen. Results of this analysis indicated that Rd may be a cost-effective alternative to VMP as initial treatment for transplant-ineligible patients with MM, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio well within the levels for recent advancements in oncology.},

However, costs of all other (unrelated) diseases in life-years gained can be estimated in such a way.},

For patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma conditional relative survival improved strongly during the first year after diagnosis (from 48\% to 68\%) and gradually thereafter to 93\% after 16 years. There were differences between morphological entities. Initial differences in conditional relative survival at diagnosis between groups with different disease stages became smaller with increasing number of years survived. Age remained a prognostic indicator, also after prolonged follow-up. These results help caregivers to plan optimal surveillance and inform patients about their actual prognosis during follow-up. Long-lasting excess mortality among patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma indicates the need for additional care long after their diagnosis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: In 2006, we published the results of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer phase III trial EORTC 20981 on the role of rituximab in remission induction and maintenance treatment of relapsed/resistant follicular lymphoma (FL). At that time, the median follow-up for the maintenance phase was 33 months. Now, we report the long-term outcome of maintenance treatment, with a median follow-up of 6 years.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Overall, 465 patients were randomly assigned to induction with either six cycles of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP). Those in complete remission or partial remission after induction (n = 334) were randomly assigned to maintenance treatment with rituximab (375 mg/m(2) intravenously once every 3 months) or observation.
RESULTS: Rituximab maintenance significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with observation (median, 3.7 years v 1.3 years; P {$<$} .001; hazard ratio [HR], 0.55), both after CHOP induction (P {$<$} .001; HR, 0.37) and R-CHOP (P = .003; HR, 0.69). The 5-year overall survival (OS) was 74\% in the rituximab maintenance arm, and it was 64\% in the observation arm (P = .07). After progression, a rituximab-containing salvage therapy was given to 59\% of patients treated with CHOP followed by observation, compared with 26\% after R-CHOP followed by rituximab maintenance. Rituximab maintenance was associated with a significant increase in grades 3 to 4 infections: 9.7\% v 2.4\% (P = .01).
CONCLUSION: With long-term follow-up, we confirm the superior PFS with rituximab maintenance in relapsed/resistant FL. The improvement of OS did not reach statistical significance, possibly because of the unbalanced use of rituximab in post-protocol salvage treatment.},

  abstract = {As part of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence's (NICE's) Single Technology Appraisal (STA) process, Novartis submitted evidence on the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of tisagenlecleucel for treating paediatric and young adult patients (under the age of 25~years) with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). This article presents a summary of the Evidence Review Group's (ERG's) independent review of the evidence submission, the committee's deliberations, and the subsequent development of NICE guidance for the use of tisagenlecleucel on the National Health Service (NHS) in England. Tisagenlecleucel is a chimeric antigen receptor-modified T-cell (CAR-T) product, the first of this emerging therapeutic class to be considered by NICE in this indication. The company's evidence submission was based upon three single-arm, phase II studies: ELIANA, ENSIGN, and B2101J. These trials demonstrated a beneficial effect of tisagenlecleucel, with significant extensions in event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to historical control datasets on blinatumomab and salvage chemotherapy. Adverse events were common; 77\% of patients suffered from cytokine release syndrome (CRS), 56\% of whom required intensive care unit-level care. The ERG did not consider clofarabine monotherapy an appropriate proxy for salvage chemotherapy. The company presented a hybrid cost-effectiveness model, combining a decision tree and three-state partitioned survival model structure. The majority of quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained were generated through additional life-years in the extrapolated `long-term survival' phase of the model, where patients were assumed to be `cured'. The ERG considered the results to be subject to substantial uncertainty, due in part to immature trial data, unresolved long-term treatment effects, and a lack of appropriate comparator data. The ERG implemented a number of changes to the company's model in an alternative base case, producing deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of \textsterling{}45,397 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and \textsterling{}27,732 versus blinatumomab. The probabilistic model produced ICERs of \textsterling{}48,265 per QALY gained versus salvage chemotherapy, and \textsterling{}29,501 versus blinatumomab. The committee considered the ERG's analysis to be most closely aligned with their preferred assumptions, and did not consider tisagenlecleucel to meet both of the end-of-life (EoL) criteria. In recognition of the innovative nature of tisagenlecleucel, and the present immaturity of ongoing clinical trials, the committee considered further data collection would be valuable in resolving uncertainties around OS, the technology's novel mechanism of action, and the management of CRS and B-cell aplasia. The committee therefore recommended tisagenlecleucel for use in the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF) until the conclusion of the ELIANA study (June 2023). This appraisal highlighted the difficulty of interpreting EoL criteria in the context of curative therapies and the valuation of cure versus extension of life. Further clarification of NICE's position in these situations may be necessary to ensure consistency and equity in their decision-making.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard treatment for untreated advanced-stage follicular lymphoma is rituximab plus chemotherapy. The incidence of histological transformation of follicular lymphoma has been reported only in heterogeneously treated populations and rarely with long-term follow-up. Additionally, the incidence of secondary malignancies after treatment, without high-dose therapy for follicular lymphoma, is largely unknown. The aim of our study was to assess progression-free survival, overall survival, incidence of secondary malignancies, and incidence of histological transformation in a 10-year follow-up analysis of the JCOG0203 trial. Methods: In the phase 2\textendash{}3 randomised JCOG0203 trial, previously untreated patients with stage III or IV indolent B-cell lymphoma, including grades 1\textendash{}3 follicular lymphoma, from 44 hospital centres in Japan, were randomly assigned (1:1) by use of a minimisation method to receive six cycles of R-CHOP (rituximab [375 mg/m 2 ], given on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide [750 mg/m 2 ], doxorubicin [50 mg/m 2 ], vincristine [1{$\cdot$}4 mg/m 2 , capped at 2{$\cdot$}0 mg] given intravenously on day 3, and oral prednisone [100 mg once daily on days 3\textendash{}7]) every 3 weeks (R-CHOP-21) or every 2 weeks (enabled by mandatory granulocyte-colony stimulating factor administration once daily for 6 days, starting on day 8; R-CHOP-14) without rituximab maintenance. Age, bulky disease (nodal or extranodal mass {$\geq$}10 cm in diameter on CT), and institution were used as adjustment factors. Investigators enrolled participants, and assignment to trial groups was done with a computer-assisted randomisation allocation sequence that took place centrally at the Japan Clinical Oncology Group Data Center, without the intervention of investigators. Interventions were not masked for patients or investigators. Data were collected 10 years after enrolment of the last patient. The primary endpoint of the phase 3 part of the study was progression-free survival, and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 part of the study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response. Accrual was 4{$\cdot$}5 years, and follow-up was 3 years after registration was closed. Data were updated on the cutoff date of Feb 28, 2017. Intention-to-treat analyses (ie, progression-free survival, overall survival, and incidence of secondary malignancies) were predefined, to be done at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. An additional analysis of the incidence of histological transformation was defined 15 years after the protocol, on May 8, 2017, in a supplementary analysis plan, and assessed at 10 years after the last patient was enrolled. Follow-up is ongoing. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00147121. Findings: Between Sept 1, 2002, and Feb 28, 2007, 300 patients were enrolled, and 149 (50\%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-21 group and 151 (50\%) were assigned to the R-CHOP-14 group. After eligibility was assessed, one patient was excluded from the R-CHOP-21 group. 10-year progression-free survival was not different between groups (R-CHOP-21 33\%, 95\% CI 25\textendash{}41; R-CHOP-14 39\%, 31\textendash{}47; hazard ratio 0{$\cdot$}89, 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}67\textendash{}1{$\cdot$}17). In 248 patients with grade 1\textendash{}3a follicular lymphoma, progression-free survival was 39\% (33\textendash{}45) at 8 years and 36\% (30\textendash{}42) at 10 years. The cumulative incidence of histological transformation was 3{$\cdot$}2\% (95\% CI 1{$\cdot$}5\textendash{}6{$\cdot$}0) at 5 years, 8{$\cdot$}5\% (5{$\cdot$}4\textendash{}12{$\cdot$}4) at 8 years, and 9{$\cdot$}3\% (6{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}13{$\cdot$}4) at 10 years after enrolment. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of secondary malignancies was 8{$\cdot$}1\% (5{$\cdot$}1\textendash{}12{$\cdot$}0) and the cumulative incidence of haematological secondary malignancies was 2{$\cdot$}9\% (1{$\cdot$}3\textendash{}5{$\cdot$}5). Interpretation: R-CHOP is a viable option for first-line treatment in patients with newly diagnosed advanced follicular lymphoma. Clinicians choosing a first-line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma should be cautious of secondary malignancies caused by immunochemotherapy and severe complications of infectious diseases in the long-term follow-up\textemdash{}both of which could lead to death.

  abstract = {Rituximab is a mainstay in the therapy for a broad variety of B-cell malignancies. Despite its undeniable therapeutic value, we still do not fully understand the mechanisms of action responsible for rituximab's anti-tumor effects. Direct signaling, complement-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC), and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) all appear to play a role in rituximab efficacy. In vitro, animal model and clinical data addressing each of these mechanisms of action are reviewed, as are data speaking to the complexity of interactions between these mechanisms. Taken together, these data suggest different mechanisms are likely important in different scenarios. Study of the complex mechanisms of action that contribute to the clinical efficacy of rituximab have led to novel clinical trials including novel combinations, schedules, and generation of additional antibodies designed to have even greater effect. Such studies need to be accompanied by rigorous correlative analysis if we are to understand the importance of various mechanisms of action of rituximab and use that information to improve on what is already an indispensable component of therapy.},

Methods: Data were obtained from a European (97\%) and Australian (3\%) observational study of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) receiving CHOP ({$\pm$}rituximab) chemotherapy. For each patient, each cycle of chemotherapy within the course, and each occurrence of FN within cycles, was identified. Patients developing FN in a given cycle (``FN patients''), starting with the first, were matched to those who did not develop FN in that cycle (``comparison patients''), irrespective of subsequent FN events. FN-related healthcare costs (\textsterling{}2010) were tallied for the initial FN event as well as follow-on care and FN events in subsequent cycles.
Results: Mean total cost was \textsterling{}5776 (95\%CI \textsterling{}4928-\textsterling{}6713) higher for FN patients (n = 295) versus comparison patients, comprising \textsterling{}4051 (\textsterling{}3633-\textsterling{}4485) for the initial event and a difference of \textsterling{}1725 (\textsterling{}978-\textsterling{}2498) in subsequent cycles. Among FN patients requiring inpatient care (76\% of all FN patients), mean total cost was higher by \textsterling{}7259 (\textsterling{}6327-\textsterling{}8205), comprising \textsterling{}5281 (\textsterling{}4810-\textsterling{}5774) for the initial hospitalization and a difference of \textsterling{}1978 (\textsterling{}1262-\textsterling{}2801) in subsequent cycles.
Conclusions: Cost of chemotherapy-induced FN among NHL patients in European and Australian clinical practice is substantial; a sizable percentage is attributable to follow-on care and subsequent FN events.},

  abstract = {Importance Among children and young adults with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the rate of 5-year disease-free survival is 10\% to 20\%. Approval of tisagenlecleucel, a chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, represents a new and potentially curative treatment option. However, tisagenlecleucel is expensive, with a current list price of \$475000 per one-time administration. Objective To estimate the long-term survival and value of tisagenlecleucel for children and young adults with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cost-effectiveness analysis, a decision analytic model was designed to extrapolate trial evidence to a patient lifetime horizon. The survival evidence for the model was extracted from 3 studies: B2202 (enrolled patients from April 8, 2015, to November 23, 2016), B2205J (enrolled patients from August 14, 2014, to February 1, 2016), and B2101J (enrolled patients from March 15, 2012, to November 30, 2015). Long-term survival and outcomes of patients younger than 25 years with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in second or later relapse were derived using flexible parametric modeling from the direct extrapolation of event-free survival and overall survival curves. The published Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized from November 1, 2017, to November 30, 2017, using an algorithm to impute patient-level time-to-event data. Sensitivity and scenario analyses assessed uncertainty in the evidence and model assumptions to further bound the range of cost-effectiveness. Data were analyzed from December 1, 2017, to March 31, 2018. Interventions The primary intervention of interest was tisagenlecleucel. The comparator of interest was the chemoimmunotherapeutic agent clofarabine. Main Outcomes and Measures Model outcomes included life-years gained, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained, and incremental costs per life-year and QALY gained. Results Forty percent of patients initiating treatment with tisagenlecleucel are expected to be long-term survivors, or alive and responding to treatment after 5 years. Tisagenlecleucel had a total discounted cost of \$667000, with discounted life-years gained of 10.34 years and 9.28 QALYs gained. The clofarabine comparator had a total discounted cost of approximately \$337000, with discounted life-years gained of 2.43 years and 2.10 QALYs gained. This difference resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately \$42000 per life-year gained and approximately \$46000 per QALY gained for tisagenlecleucel vs clofarabine. These results were robust to probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Across scenario analyses that included more conservative assumptions regarding long-term relapse and survival, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ranged from \$37000 to \$78000 per QALY gained. Conclusions and Relevance Tisagenlecleucel likely provides gains in survival and seems to be priced in alignment with these benefits. This study suggests that payers and innovators should develop novel payment models that reduce the risk and uncertainty around long-term value and provide safeguards to ensure high-value care.},

It is expected to have long-term survival benefits; however, long-term survival data are limited.To estimate the long-term survival and cost-effectiveness of axicabtagene ciloleucel for treatment of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma.Economic evaluation study using a survival analysis that digitized and extrapolated survival curves published in the ZUMA-1 trial (Safety and Efficacy of KTE-C19 in Adults With Refractory Aggressive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma), which enrolled patients between November 2015 and September 2016 and had a maximum follow-up of 24 months. Five different survival models (standard parametric, flexible parametric, 2 mixture cure models, and a flexible parametric mixture model) were used to extrapolate the survival curves to a lifetime horizon from January through June 2018. A cost-effectiveness analysis, from both a trial-based and lifetime horizon, was also conducted to inform the value of this novel therapy. The model was based on data from 111 patients with B-cell lymphoma who were enrolled in the ZUMA-1 trial.One-time administration of axicabtagene ciloleucel compared with chemotherapy.Undiscounted and discounted life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), total costs, and incremental costs per LY and QALY gained.The modeled cohort of 111 patients started at 58 years of age. At the end of the trial, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel resulted in 0.48 more LYs and 0.34 more QALYs than chemotherapy, producing a cost-effectiveness estimate of \$896 600 per QALY for public payers and \$1 615 000 per QALY for commercial payers. Extrapolated long-term survival for patients treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel ranged from 2.83 to 9.19 discounted LYs and from 2.07 to 7.62 discounted QALYs. Incrementally, treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel was associated with 1.89 to 5.82 discounted LYs and 1.52 to 4.90 discounted QALYs vs chemotherapy. With the use of these incremental estimates of survival, cost-effectiveness estimates ranged from \$82 400 to \$230 900 per QALY gained for public payers and from \$100 400 to \$289 000 per QALY gained for commercial payers.Treatment with axicabtagene ciloleucel appears to be associated with incremental gains in survival over chemotherapy. The range in projected long-term survival was wide and reflected uncertainty owing to limited follow-up data. Cost-effectiveness is associated with long-term survival, with further evidence needed to reduce uncertainty.},

PsyMod is a state-transition cohort simulation model and considers six health states, namely ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), FEP, post-FEP, no-UHR, recovery/remission, and death. Results are expressed as total healthcare costs, QALYs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), and budget impact.Results: PsyMod was used to extrapolate budget impact and cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy for preventing FEP for individuals at UHR of psychosis (CBTuhr) compared to care as usual. CBTuhr resulted in a per-patient increase of 0.06 QALYs and a per patient cost reduction of \texteuro{}654 (dominant ICER) with a reduction in 5-year healthcare costs of \texteuro{}1,002,166.Conclusions: PsyMod can be used to examine cost-effectiveness and budget impact of interventions targeting prevention and treatment of FEP and is freely available for academic purposes upon request by the authors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE To determine whether adherence with one antiretroviral medication reliably predicts adherence with other antiretroviral medications. DESIGN Cross-sectional repeated-measurement analysis. SETTING Cohort study enrolling patients from Massachusetts and Rhode Island. PATIENTS Total of 454 patients using antiretroviral medications for HIV infection. METHODS For each antiretroviral medication, we asked patients to report how many days in the last week they had 1) missed a dose of the medication and 2) been off schedule with a dose of the medication. The reliability coefficient was used to compare between-pfile:///C:/Users/58509wth/Downloads/00126334-200111010-00009.pdferson variance in adherence rates with total variance, which is the sum of between-person and within-person variance. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 42 years; 28\% were women and 37\% were nonwhite. Sixty-six percent of patients were on three or more antiretroviral medications. Perfect adherence was reported by 42\% of patients, and patients reported missing a dose on a mean of 1.5 days per week for each antiretroviral medication currently being taken. The reliability coefficient for days in the last week that the medication was missed was 0.85 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.87), and for days off-schedule in the last week, it was 0.88 (CI: 0.86-0.89). CONCLUSIONS Most of the variability in antiretroviral adherence in this study was accounted for by between-patient differences in overall adherence rather than by within-patient differences in adherence patterns across medications. These data support the theory that when patients skip or are off schedule with doses, they skip or are off schedule with all the antiretroviral medications taken at that time. In the course of exploring patients' adherence issues, clinicians may find it useful to inquire about problematic dosing times. Researchers assessing adherence may not need to separately monitor adherence with each antiretroviral medication in a regimen.},

  abstract = {Cost-utility models are increasingly used in many countries to establish whether the cost of a new intervention can be justified in terms of health benefits. Health-state utility (HSU) estimates (the preference for a given state of health on a cardinal scale where 0 represents dead and 1 represents full health) are typically among the most important and uncertain data inputs in cost-utility models. Clinical trials represent an important opportunity for the collection of health-utility data. However, trials designed primarily to evaluate efficacy and safety often present challenges to the optimal collection of HSU estimates for economic models. Careful planning is needed to determine which of the HSU estimates may be measured in planned trials; to establish the optimal methodology; and to plan any additional studies needed. This report aimed to provide a framework for researchers to plan the collection of health-utility data in clinical studies to provide high-quality HSU estimates for economic modeling. Recommendations are made for early planning of health-utility data collection within a research and development program; design of health-utility data collection during protocol development for a planned clinical trial; design of prospective and cross-sectional observational studies and alternative study types; and statistical analyses and reporting.},

Most of these have been subject to detailed discussion within the economic evaluation literature. This has not been the case for one approach, partitioned survival analysis, which has been used extensively in the NICE Technology Appraisal (TA) Programme and is now the most commonly used decision modelling approach for appraisals of interventions for advanced or metastatic cancers. The objective of this Technical Support Document (TSD) is to describe and critique partitioned survival analysis when used as a decision modelling tool in order to assist different stakeholders in determining its appropriateness as a basis for informing policy decisions. The focus of this TSD is the application of partitioned survival analysis in appraisals of cancer treatments as this is where the approach has been used most frequently to date. Nonetheless, the TSD has broader relevance for the application of partitioned survival analysis as a decision modelling approach in other clinical settings},
