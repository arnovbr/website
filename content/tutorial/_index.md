There is probably nothing more annoying than doing things all over again or 
"inventing the wheel twice". Doing research, and especially economic evaluations,
is often exactly just that:

* re-calculating transition rates
* searching for the latest consumer price index or the friction period
* fitting parametric survival model
* visualising 'standard' outputs
* and many more

This list may be endless. And although I (or certainly one of my colleagues)
recently looked-up the source documentation/data somewhere, that particular
link, script or text seems to have vanished from my PC. Or from my laptop,
or Dropbox, or the shared network drive at work, or wherever I stored it.

Not only I find these searches annoying, I especially find them time consuming.
So this is the core aim of this website: create myself a repository of 'tutorials'
to help me being more effective. Maybe some of these tutorial are useful to
you as well. If you have comments or suggestion on the code please let me know.
