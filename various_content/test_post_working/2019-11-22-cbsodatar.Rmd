# TL; DR
Learn how to use data from *Statistics Netherlands (CBS)* for health economic
evaluations in R to calculate:  

- the most recent consumer price index (CPI) for the Netherlands

# Introduction
The Dutch reference manual for health economic evualtions [@hakkart-vanroijenKostenhandleidingMethodologieVan2016] is a very handy starting
point for most methodologies employed in health economic modelling. It provides
many calculation examples and reference prices, which is why it is also the 
most frequently dowloaded item in my computer (whenever I need it, I 'quickly' google
it and its link is a PDF file which downloads automcatically [[try it](https://www.zorginstituutnederland.nl/binaries/zinl/documenten/publicatie/2016/02/29/richtlijn-voor-het-uitvoeren-van-economische-evaluaties-in-de-gezondheidszorg/Richtlijn+voor+het+uitvoeren+van+economische+evaluaties+in+de+gezondheidszorg+%28verdiepingsmodules%29.pdf)]).

The only downside to the manual is that it is static and with every year the stated
reference prices become older.

The [iMTA Costing Tool](https://www.imta.nl/costingtool/)
aims at 'updating' these costs and proposes to use the consumer price index (CPI)
provided by [*Statistics Netherlands (CBS)*](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70936ned/table?fromstatweb).
Despite applauding
the effort of someone gathering all reference prices from the manual to put
them into an Excel file (most certainly by hand), there are several limitations
to the tool:

- It is in Dutch
- It is written in Excel
- Inflation rates (i.e. the recommended CPI) need to be looked-up externally (link provided in toll and [here](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70936ned/table?fromstatweb))
- Inflation rates need to be inserted by hand (see Figure \ref(fig:costing-tool))
- Updated data is generated in Excel and need to be transferred to the acutal project with copy/paste

```{r costing-tool, fig.cap="Example of setting inflation rates in the iMTA costing tool"}
include_graphics(path = "/img/costing_tool.png")
```

## Aim
In this post, I will demonstrate how you can use the **cbsodataR** package written
by CBS to 'dynamically' retrieve CPI rates for whatever year(s) you need. If
you have your data in R, there is no need to extract these data and hence any
possible errors that may arise from copy/paste can be avoided.

## Assumptions
There are a couple of assumptions I make for this posts. These are:

- You work in a dedicated R project folder
- You are familiar with and use the package **here** or you know how to access files within your R-project
- You are familiar with `pipes` in R and use - or at least understand - them

# Do
First we need to install the **cbsodataR** package from CRAN via `install.packages("cbsodataR")` and then load it with `library("cbsodataR")`.
I also load **dplyr** for an easy-to-read data wrangling and `pipes`.

```{r echo=TRUE}
# install.packages("cbsodataR")
# library("cbsodataR")
# library("dplyr")
```

With the **cbsodataR** we can download most (if not all) publicly available
data from the CBS servers. To explore available data tables we can dowload the
table of content via `cbsodataR::cbs_get_toc()`. This might take a while since
there a quite some data tables available (more than 4600 at the time of writing
this post). For this exercise, the table of contents is not relevant as we already
know what table we need. Therefore, the below code is not run.

```{r toc, echo=TRUE}
#cbs_toc <- cbsodataR::cbs_get_toc()
```

There are several ways to find out about the table identifier you need/want. One
way is to browse the table of contents we just downloaded or by finding the
table of interest on the CBS website and have a look the its URL. The link in the
iMTA costing tool (Excel sheet 'Instellingen') directs to:

https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70936ned/table?fromstatweb

The table identifier part of this URL is "70936ned".

We can now download this data into our `data` folder (or any other folder) with
`cbs_get_data`:

```{r dowload, echo = TRUE}
# df_cbs_cpi <- cbsodataR::cbs_get_data(id = "70936ned",
#                                       dir = here::here("data/cbs_cpi/"))
```

Let's have a look at the first rows.

```{r}
#head(df_cbs_cpi)
```

We see CPI data as from january 1963 (1963MM01) for each month. But what we are
interested in are the data for the entire year. This is also availbale. If we
look at more than just the `head()` of the data, we see that the years are coded
as a character value in the column `Perioden`. For 1964 this is `"1964JJ00"`.
We could no filter the dataset with **dplyr**'s `filter()` function, but then
we would need to search for the pattern "JJ" whithin `Perioden`. This might be
prone to errors.

Luckily, **cbsodataR** comes with several functions that make use of the "other"
data we imported.

## Working with dates
The **cbsodataR** function `cbs_add_date_column()` is adding a few columns to
our data of class `date` and `factor`. We can use this as follows:

```{r}
# df_cbs_cpi <- df_cbs_cpi %>% 
#         cbsodataR::cbs_add_date_column(.)
# 
# head(df_cbs_cpi)
```

Now we also have the columns `Perioden_Date` and `Period_freq`.

Filtering for years has just become easier, as we only need to filter column
`Perioden_feq` for "Y".

Let's do it:
```{r}
# df_cbs_cpi_yr <- df_cbs_cpi %>% 
#         dplyr::filter(Perioden_freq == "Y")
```

Now that we have all the data we need, we can calculate the CPI of each year,
relative to a reference year. From the CBS data we just downloaded, the most
recent year is 2018. So this will also be out reference year.

```{r}
# df_cbs_cpi_yr %>% 
#         mutate(factor = 1 + JaarmutatieCPI_1 / 100)
```


To calculate CPIs for different years there are many ways to take it from here.
I will show one which is (hopefully) easily understandable/readable but 
requires several steps.
For the unexperienced R user this comes at the benefit of readability but at the
cost of speed (although this might be negligible).

Let's create a nice and clean `data.frame` and get rid of all the stuff we don't
need. In the following, I will create a column with the years only using the
package **lubridate**. Then I will only keep columns of interest.

```{r}
# df_cbs_cpi_yr %>% 
#         # create column
#         mutate(year = lubridate::year(Perioden_Date),
#                factor = 1 + JaarmutatieCPI_1 / 100) %>% 
#         select(year, factor)
```
