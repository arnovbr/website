 had some experience in but was impressed by a programme that a friend of mine used for his research: R. I knew I had to make the switch at some point and decided to do it rather earlier than later. One can read everywhere that the learning curve for R is quite steep. Unfortunately, R behaves like most other things, following the principle of 'use it or loose it'. To keep practicing, I decided to do as much in R as possible. This can lead to strange behaviour: even if I have to add up some numbers I would rather start R than using my phones or computers calculator.
